I am a relative amateur when it comes to the content, so any additions, corrections, suggestions, or other interaction in the chat would be greatly appreciated!

But what I don't like about the majority of the more known plays is that they're tragedies, and definitely don't have much of a happy ending. And I like the sad endings on occasion, but they're really bumming me out right now lol. 

So, are there any greek (or other historic) plays that have happy-is endings? I'm thinking comedies and saytrs *could* fall under this, but I'm not sure (Lysistrata seems to be ok). And I'm tired of reasing about the main character blinding themselves or being cursed!

1641071870,"Drawing Comparisons: Antipater, Regent of the Argeads. The Macedonian Tywin Lannister","Was thinking about it earlier today how Antipater was such a savy player of geopolitics, especially in the years soon after Alexander's death. Ive found him to be a truly under-apprecaited figure in history considering the shrewdness of some of his decisions. These bare a marked similarity (at least in my opinion) to another ""power behind the throne"" type, only this one is a fictitious patriarch in a fantasy series..a little known bit of contemporary culture called game of thrones. The character is the head of House Lannister; Tywin son of Tytos. 

 I was wondering if these two figures could be used as a charcater study of one another, kinda like mirrors of each other especially since I'm working on a dissertation regarding the Hellenistic Period. Some things I noticed:

1) Competerence: Antipater kept Alexander's eastern push going, feeding the army with reinforcements while putting down rebellions among the Spartans and Thracians, much like Tywin did in his early years during the Tarbeck rebellions and his tenure as hand of the king.

2) Political maneuvering: After Alexander died Antipater managed to mostly corner the marriage market of the nobility, securing several important alliances to ensure his position and that of his family - something Tywin also tries to do with his own kids, except Jaime and Cersei have different plans...namely with each other.

3) Daddy issues: They both reject and effectively disinherit their most capable sons (Cassander for Antipater, Tyrion for Tywin) forcing them to make their own way in the world. 

4) Rocky relationships with their Royal Masters: Antipater and Queen Olympias began well enough, even joining forces to make sure Alexander assumed the crown after his father's death, but after competing for influence in Macedon after Alexander went off to conquer the world, they became mortal enemies. Aerys and Tywin also began on a good footing, but as the king went mad he started to get jealous of Tywin. Things went downhill from there.

5) Turbulent begginings / Identity as Reformers: Macedonia was a powder keg of instability before Philip, Antipater, and a slew of other Old guard generals turned it into a functional state. Before them civil wars during periods of succession had been common, as was political assassination. Likewise  House Lannister had become a laughing stock by the time Tywin arrived on the scene; with unruly lords and lands infested with brigandry and crime. His iron fist turned it into one of the most feared and powerful houses in the seven kingdoms, and before that he had fought in the war of the nine penny kings at a relatively young age.

The list was surprising when I thought about it and Antipater is a fascinating figure I wish we knew more about. I am curious to know what you guys think, and if you have anything to add.",ancientgreece

The Thracians would become famous for their fighting abilities in foreign armies as mercenaries, often fulfilling the role of skirmishes, excelling at hit and run tactics. Though, in the 6th and early 5th centuries we receive very little detail of their battles.

1638153906,Lysistrata is the ultimate No-Nut November play.,"I’m being facetious, of course, but what better time of year than now to read (or re-read) Aristophanes’ “Lysistrata”? 

This is a really interesting one to me for several reasons. I’m relatively a novice to Ancient Greek literature and have only recently begun to tackle some of it because of how intimidating it can seem. 

For one, the Lysistrata is obviously extremely dirty, but beyond that, it’s one of the only works of Ancient Greek literature I’ve read that holds up extremely well for today’s audiences without having to know much about the culture, political system, religions, social mores, etc. When I read Homer I often feel like I’m reading about an alien planet, the customs are so odd. That’s enjoyable and informative in a different way, but in my opinion, with the Lysistrata, you can really just jump right in as a novice and (with a few exceptions), the jokes will make plenty of sense even without footnotes. 

29 of the 40 plays Aristophanes wrote are lost to time, which bums me out, but the 11 we do have are fascinating. I’m looking forward to reading more of them.  

Does anyone else feel that way about this particular play? And/or do you have suggestions for other good short works that might be easier for beginners to access?",ancientgreece

1638068790,Any Art History buffs who can help a college kid out?,"Hey! 

Writing an essay arguing that some rulers/politicians in Ancient Greece and Rome depicted themselves with references to mythology, as the associated myth (or god) conveyed a value which they wished to be associated with b/c it would benefit them politically. It's for a Classical Art class. 

I have two examples so far:  

1. A [tetradrachm](https://www.slam.org/collection/objects/36557/) depicting Alexander the Great wearing the pelt of the Nymean lion which Heracles traditionally wore. Mostly arguing the association is twofold: Promoting the idea of overwhelming excellence in achievement, as Heracles successfully completed his tasks; AND that Heracles had the rare honor of being deified after death, so Alexander may share this fate because he's so great.
2. The [Augustus of Primaporta](https://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/collezioni/musei/braccio-nuovo/Augusto-di-Prima-Porta.html), which has the following gods/goddesses depicted on the chest piece: Sol (sun) and caelus (sky), tellus (earth goddess), Apollo, Aurora and Diana. I'm arguing that this was done to emphasize the fact that Augustus possessed a connection to the gods, a connection to the past, and martial prowess -- thereby, he was an emperor worthy of respect.

I really need a third example, but can't think of one. Do you guys know of anything that might resemble these two -- a political figure adopting mythology to communicate a message? Dying, because I have to present the outline of my paper this coming Monday.",ancientgreece

Damn I think this greatly damaged and oversimplified the city-state view very badly, meanwhile its glorification is inoffensive it also became associated with nazi scum and such, I noticed how many people constantly is more concerned about demonizing Spartans as baby eaters, rapists, and nazis rather than actually learn more about it, comparisons to other city-states of the time and how it really operated, as someone who loves the greek state this saddens me very much and I feel like people try to say to me that what I like is wrong.",ancientgreece

&gt;Build  a house, ten cubits high, with all the sides of equal dimensions,  with  one door, and four windows, one on each side; put an ox into it,   thirty months old, very fat and fleshy; let a number of young men kill   him by beating him violently with clubs, so as to mangle both flesh and   bones, but taking care not to shed any blood; let all the orifices,   mouth, eyes, nose etc. be stopped up with clean and fine linen,   impregnated with pitch; let a quantity of thyme be strewed under the   reclining animal, and then let windows and doors be closed and covered   with a thick coating of clay, to prevent the access of air or wind.   After three weeks have passed, let the house be opened, and let light   and fresh air get access to it, except from the side from which the wind   blows strongest. Eleven days afterwards, you will find the house full   of bees, hanging together in clusters, and nothing left of the ox but   horns, bones and hair.

*From the Byzantine ""Geoponika"".*

I have a few questions :

1. Why  those two animals specifically, a large ruminant giving birth to small  insects ? Are they ""naturally"" linked to each other, or do the ritual  artificially forces the cow to produce bees ?
2. Did the ancient Greeks believed in other combinations straying from the ""Ox to bees"" original ritual, with other species of animals ?
3. Is there any additional sources on the subject ?

I have a VERY hard time believing this, and I wonder where exactly this came about and why so many people seem to think he was just a lucky general? The only thing lucky about him is how he managed to not die despite being in the front lines constantly, and how an arrow shot him in the chest and could have killed him but he also survived. Yes, Persia was an insanely powerful foe, but I don't think you can so easily dismiss his commanding abilities either. He was able to inspire and motivate his troops with epic speeches, we know of one such epic speech after a conspiracy to mutiny. He was an able fighter himself, constantly in the heat of danger and on the front lines. Among much more.

“In Asia, after the defeat of Demetrius at Gaza in Syria, Seleucus received from Ptolemy not more than 800 infantry and about 200 cavalry, and set out for Babylon. So high were his expectations that even without any military force at all but accompanied only by his friends and his own slaves he would have undertaken the march into the interior. He reckoned that the Babylonians would readily join his side because of the goodwill they already felt towards him, while Antigonus, by withdrawing his forces a long distance away, had provided him with a suitable opportunity to realise his own ambitions. While he himself was full of eagerness, the friends around him could see that the troops with them were very few in number but that their opponents had large forces available, abundant supplies and a mass of allies, and they were very discouraged. When Seleucus saw their alarm he encouraged them, reminding them that those who had campaigned with Alexander and who had been promoted by him because of their valour should not, when facing adversity, put their trust solely in armed forces and money but in experience and skill, the means by which Alexander himself had achieved his great and universally admired deeds. They should also trust the forecast of the gods, that the end of the expedition would be worthy of his purpose: for when he had consulted the oracle at Branchidae the god had addressed him as King Seleucus, and Alexander himself appearing to him in a dream had given him a clear sign of good and admired among men is achieved by exertion and taking risks. He also courted the favour of his fellow soldiers and dealt with all of them as an equal, which made everyone respect him and be ready to face willingly the perils of the bold venture.” - Diodorus, XIX.90 

I’m new to studying the Ancient Greek world and it’s history and especially the Hellenistic World or Hellenistic Period that followed after the death of Alexander the Great.

1635848557,Halloween Mirrors Spooky Beliefs of the Ancient Greeks," Could Halloween, the annual celebration observed in numerous countries across the world on October 31, have ancient Greek roots?

Halloween activities, such as donning spooky costumes, trick or treating, attending costume parties, carving pumpkins, watching scary movies, and visiting pumpkin patches and haunted sites, make the holiday extremely popular amongst the young and the old.

### Halloween likely has roots in Celtic pagan festivals

Yet the celebration is not as secular as it may seem. Also known as All Hallow’s Eve, Halloween has a religious connection. It takes place on the day before the western Christian feast of All Saints’ Day, or All Hallows’ Day. For believers, it is a time to honor and remember the dead, particularly saints and martyrs.

 The many traditions associated with Halloween, however, link it to pagan practices. Most scholars agree that the roots of Halloween and related traditions can be found in pagan Celtic harvest festivals, particularly Samhain.

Likely, these long-held, important traditions and festivals remained even after the Celts were Christianized, and were connected to Christian celebrations.

Much of the Halloween celebrations and traditions that are practiced today were made popular after immigrants from Ireland and Scotland brought them to North America in the 19th century.

Although Halloween itself is linked to Celtic practices, the spooky holiday has many parallels to ancient Greek beliefs as well.

### Ancient Greeks loved spooky tales, like those told on Halloween

  [Debbie Felton](https://www.umass.edu/classics/member/debbie-felton), Professor of Classics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has revealed that “long before Halloween became popular, [ancient Greeks ](https://greekreporter.com/tag/ancient-greeks/)and Romans enjoyed spinning good scary stories about the afterlife, as well as ghosts and monsters.”

In her novel study, entitled “Haunted [Greece](https://greekreporter.com/greece/) and Rome: Ghost Stories from Classical Antiquity,” Felton examined various interesting stories of ghostly spirits and haunting from ancient times, shedding new light on the modern folkloric traditions on the supernatural and[ the monstrous](https://greekreporter.com/2021/09/18/ancient-greek-origins-werewolves/).

“There are many reasons why people enjoy them and enjoy being scared by them. There’s certainly a cathartic effect to hearing a ghost story and being scared out of your wits without ever being in any real danger,” Professor Felton has shared.

Remaining dead serious about the deep connection of Halloween ghosts and monsters with Classical Antiquity’s terrifying narrations, Felton added: “… ghost stories ultimately reflect religious beliefs concerning the importance [of a proper burial](https://greekreporter.com/2021/08/27/greek-funeral-customs-from-ancient-times-to-today/) and the survival of the spirit after death. The dead have a need to rest in peace, while the living have a need to believe in an afterlife…”

 The professor is an editor of the interdisciplinary academic journal [“Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural,” ](https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/preternature/)which is published by [Penn State University Press](http://www.psupress.org/).

According to Felton, monsters and serial killers, either real or fictional, “have been with us since earliest antiquity,” being often “even more horrifying than their modern counterparts,” while she is skeptical about the existence of ghosts.",ancientgreece

1635675804,Went to the Acropolis yesterday but was disappointed because I did not have a guide. Should I go back with a guide?,"I have a big fascination for philosophy and the Ancient Greek culture. So for my trip to Athens I really wanted to learn more about it's rich history with context. I thought solo-ing the Acropolis and it's museum at my pace would do that, but it has left me feeling disappointed. Mostly because I am not learning or feel like I am engaged with the history in front of me as I would like to. I would occasionally hear guides for other groups and thought that that was exactly what would help,  


I am here for 2 more days, do you think going back to the acropolis with a guide would be worthwhile, or should I cut my losses and do a guide for a different activity. (I also like nature if you think I should just double down and connect with my inner self / natural world of Greece)

1635264984,A Griffin Warrior: A Staggering Discovery from Ancient Greece," 

The discovery of the Griffin Warrior Tomb is one of the most fascinating archaeological findings as it seems to link the Minoan and the Mycenaean civilisations.

On May 28, 2015, the archaeologists excavating in Pylos, southwestern Greece, discovered a Bronze Age tomb with a skeleton surrounded by rich artefacts, suggesting it belonged to an important man.

The grave belongs to the Mycenaean Civilisation, approximately 1750 BC-1050 BC. Also, many of the objects found seem to be related to the Minoan Civilisation, c. 3500 BC – 1100 BC.

 

Overall archaeological research has shown that the Mycenaean had reached most of the eastern Mediterranean, including ancient Egypt, the city-states of the Near East (today’s Turkey), and the islands of the Mediterranean.

However, the strongest connection discovered is the one with the Minoan Civilisation in the island of Crete.

The Minoan Civilisation was named after the legendary King Minos, but the islanders’ culture was very different from that found on mainland Greece.",ancientgreece

We're just back from an amazing holiday in Rhodes and my GF and I had a slight disagreement over the formation of some rocks on Ixia beach toward Rhodes town. (Bear with me, I know rocks are boring) 

The beach is entirely pebbled and there are large pieces of rock, just off the road and at the bottom of a hill, which to me look like they could've been part of an ancient sea defence wall - pebbles layered with what looks like mortar.

1634276145,"Byzantines: Greeks, Romans, or Greeks cosplaying as Romans?","So this is a controversial topic, especially among Roman history enthusiasts (less among Roman history *scholars*), but I want the opinions of some of you Hellenophiles. Obviously this goes beyond the ~400CE (which is a strange date for setting the end of the Ancient era IMO) time frame, so apologies for that. 

Anyway, I am of the opinion the ""Romans"" beyond their Crisis of the Third Century began to become less and less ""Roman"" and more and more Greek over the next few centuries. It wasn't just some ""Rome ended in 224CE"" or anything so simple as that, but the Romans were 97% Roman when Septimius Severus took control, were 80% Roman by Diocletian (and like 18% Greek), and these numbers just swapped over the coming centuries. Justinian and Belisarius are often considered the ""last"" Romans, and I think this is probably a pretty good point to consider the Eastern Roman Empire becoming majority Greek. Of language, culture, architecture, religion, foodstuffs, naming, pretty much all of it. By the death of Justinian they were say 52% Greek and 35% Roman and the rest mixed Germanic, Syriac, maybe tiny bits Celtic, etc etc. 

Obviously they are almost nothing like the Archaic or Classical Hellenes. We can call them Hellenes 4.0 (Mycenaeans being 1.0, Archaic/Classical 2.0, Hellenistic in Egypt, Bactria, India, Syria, along the Euxine being 3.0). But they seem as distinct from the Romans of Camillus, Africanus, Caesar or Trajan as the Greeks were. This is why we call them the Byzantines, not simply for the ease of distinguishing them from the WRE or the Holy Roman Empire or Rum. 

I believe we should come up with a new term for these people, to highlight the fact they were mostly Greeks, or peoples that had mixed with some Greeks, or Hellenized to some degree. Helleno-Roman perhaps. Every time I have brought this up among Roman-enthusiast, the Roman fanboys basically just insult me to the point of drowning out any discussion, because they **so want** the Romans to continue to 1453. This seems much too simplistic to me. 

Anyway, I would be very interested in hearing some Hellenophiles thoughts on the Byzantines, how ""Roman"" they were, if others view them similarly to myself as primarily Greek, but heavily influenced by Italian...well everything.",ancientgreece

I had done incense rituals before to Hera and lied I was doing a house blessing with the Catechism of the Church in my hands.

I just did my first direct Hera statue in front of everyone in my family during a birthday party but because I as in front of a Mary statue they all thought I as praying to the Virgin and did not realize it was Hera I as worshiping.

1633804068,Were helots of Sparta pre Indo European people subjugated by Indo-European invaders?,"&gt;I asked this at r/askhistorians and nobody answered.


The Helots of Sparta were by all accounts treated miserably by the Spartans who are considered or believed be a group of Indo Europeans who migrated to the Greece mainland.

The treatment of Helots sound an awful like how Indo-Europeans in India treated thier subjugated people. In fact it even sounds like a caste system. Assigning them to lower castes and just generally treating them miserably. We often hear about how the Indo Europeans were a small group of invader who ruled larger local populations. Well this sounds exactly like that.

So were the Helots people in a similar situation?

I've heard Helots being described as everything from a slaves from foreign lands to neighbouring city states conquered by the Spartans. But none of the explanations make sense. But the subjugation of people and forcing them into the lower castes of society makes more sense. I mean Doric Spartans were believed to be Indo European and these people set up similar systems in India. So it wouldn't be a stretch to thing that Helots were simply pre Indo Europeans who were under foreign rule. 


It even explains the Peloponnesian war and the lack of political unity of Greece in classical era. The Achaeian Delian league being places with more pre Indo European cultures or people while the Spartans led Peloponnesian League being more Indo European. It would explain why so historical writers said that they could tell Dorics and Achaeian apart.

1632437187,Cyrus the Moses,"Xenophon Cyropedia 1.2.2
&gt;*Cyrus* was educated in conformity with the laws of the Persians; and these laws appear in their care for the common weal not to start from the same point as they do in most states. For most states permit every one to train his own children just as he will, and the older people themselves to live as they please; and then they command them **not to steal and not to rob**, not to break into anybody's house, not to strike a person whom they have no right to strike, **not to commit adultery**, not to disobey an officer, and so forth; and if a man transgress anyone one of these laws, they punish him.
 
Xenophon, Cyropaedia 1.3 *Child prodigy aged 12*
&gt; Cyrus received until he was *twelve years old* or a little more; and he showed himself superior to all the other boys of his age both in mastering his tasks quickly and in doing everything in a thorough and manly fashion  

&gt; Luke 2:42 when he was twelve years

In the Cyropedia, King Cyrus was a child prodigy and educated in Laws that includes **not to steal, not to commit adultery** and it describes breaking them as a **transgression**

The verb transgress in Xenophon is **παραβαίνω** and the Hebrew translation is **העביר**

&gt;Deuteronomy 26:13
לא עברתי ממצותיך 

&gt;οὐ παραβέβηκα τά θέσμια σου ""I have not transgressed thy laws""

The verb עברתי could also be ἁμαρτάνω.  So the language here in the Torah and Xenophon are very much the same.

Numbers 8:7 לחטאת / τῇ καθάρσει
  ""for cleansing from guilt""

&gt;&gt; Homer's Odyssey 3.446
Then the old man, Nestor, driver of chariots, began the opening rite of hand-washing and sprinkling with barley grains, and earnestly he prayed to Athena, cutting off as first offering the hair from the head, and casting it into the fire.


&gt;&gt;Electra 90
I wept and cut off a lock of my hair as an offering and sacrificed over the altar the blood of a slaughtered sheep

&gt;&gt; Numbers 6:18 — The Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.

So the rituals of the Torah are not unique to Jews, this also includes Matsza, barley cake eaten by Spartans hence eaten as a reminder of slavery.

&gt;&gt;Aeschylus Agamemnon 1035
Once endured to be sold and to eat the bread of slavery **(μάζης)**

&gt;&gt; Genesis 19:3
Made them a feast and did bake barley-cakes **(מצות)**",ancientgreece

This is kind of weird because I’ve always wondered why Pericles said in his speech that the best of women was the one who wasn’t talked about in great praise or scorn amongst men, while also being in a long term relationship with a woman like Aspasia. As a statesman, wouldn’t he want to marry and be associated with a respectable woman? 

It would make more sense of him to say that if Aspasia was writing the speech in order to appeal to the conservative athenian men in the masses and to appeal to the culture as a ghostwrite would do in genera when writing for any audience.

*“Herodotus of Halicarnassus here presents his research so that human events do not fade with time. May the great and wonderful deeds – some brought forth by the Hellenes, others by the barbarians – not go unsung; as well as the causes that led them to make war on each other.”*

These are the opening lines of one of the oldest works of history written by Herodotus, labelled the father of history. In this latest Casting Through Ancient Greece episode I turn to looking at who Herodotus was, what he covers in his histories and how he went about putting it together.

1628218239,"TALES OF gods, ART and NFT","🔱Greek mythology is filled with epic tales of adventure, from Achilles, Hercules to the story of Jason and the Argonauts, they all portray the tales of gods, goddesses, wits, and heroism. Even Hollywood can’t stop making movies out of greek mythologies and one that fascinates me is the story of Odysseus, king of an ancient greek kingdom known as Ithaca.  It was 1997 and everyone was talking about the adventure of Odysseus, Jim was my childhood buddy, a fast-talker, his fast-talking nature earned him the nickname “the comedian”, sometimes I call him Chris talker (replacing tucker with talker), lol. So there I was listening to Jim as he talked about the story of Odysseus, he was raw, unedited and that made me want to see the movie myself. Fast forward to a couple of days later, I got myself the movie, and yea, it was epic. I fell in love with Greek myths instantly, all thanks to the goddess Calypso, played by Vanessa Williams. She was alluring, Posidsein’s wrath gave me the chills and why you should not mess with the gods. Odysseus' tales explored almost all the world of the Greek myths, delivering a whole new experience of adventure 

🔱Homer was the author of Odyssey, which is the tale of Odysseus and the Iliad, both of which became the foundational works of Greek literature. Homer’s tale from Iliad believed that Oceanus and his consort Tethys, the titan's daughter of Uranus and Gaia created all living things, including the gods of Olympus

🔱Greek tales blew me into the world of arts, the gods were known to be an embodiment of perfect chiseled physiology and beauty, used by some artists as a reference to bring their creativity to life. The idea of life and invisible forces, challenged the creative skills of artists in the Greco-Roman world, which is the central point to the development of art in the Western world. I started taking some art classes from Proko. Quite challenging but every inch of my practice drew me closer to achieving my dream of becoming an artist focused on the genre that I have come to admire, which is Greek mythology.

🔱As the years went by, I became better and the quest to transform my art into liquid cash was relevant. And so came the rise of NFTs but the emergence of various platforms made it a challenge of picking one tailored to fit my needs. It wasn’t long before I came in contact with THEOS (The Hyper Economy Operating System). The striking part of this project is the artistic beauty of their user interface and story that is inspired by Greek mythology.

🔱THEOS is the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) paradise of NFTs that guarantees instant liquidity for both fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This is precisely what I need, it’s going to be an NFT marketplace and will be automated to fit the dynamic nature of prices that we see in the NFT niche. The project aims to bring real-world assets into the blockchain industry with a proper incentive ecosystem. Oh yea I forgot, they have something called the “ODYSSEY POOL”, which brings back memories and has a wide use cases

🔱NFTs have revolutionized cryptocurrency in a very short period and with THEOS, your data which could be art, virtual goods for games, etc can easily be turned into liquid intellectual property. The concept brought forth by THEOS is a good one, bringing in new life to the blockchain industry while lighting up the sky in a glorious way, just like the lightning bolt of Zeus.",ancientgreece

[The Greek and Persian Wars](https://preview.redd.it/2rp8xmmombe71.jpg?width=270&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95c9f3b033f5eac3bc1f5c5c4546f836553a7eee)

The Greek and Persian wars would be a defining moment in the Greek world helping shape the trajectory of development in Greece and around the Aegean for time to come. Even today a detailed ancient account survives describing the events of 2500 years in what is one of the oldest works of history. Herodotus who has been labelled the father of history would be born during the wars and would travel the Greek world later in life collecting all he could, so as to understand what brought the Greeks and Persian to make war.

In this episode we will be looking back at the last 18 episodes that looked at the Greco-Persian Wars and try and tie everything together, so as to refresh ourselves on all that has taken place over the 21 years since the Ionian revolt. This will then put us in a good position to then move on with the narrative of the series.

The Greek and Persian Wars are often seen as beginning with the decision by Athens and Eretria to send ships to aide the Ionian revolt. Herodotus would say; “These ships were the beginnings of evil for both Hellenes and Barbarians”. The revolt would ultimately fail and Persian attention would now be focused on Greece.

Two main invasions would be launched that would directly attack Greece, these coming in 490 BC and 48 BC. In these two invasions we see some of the most well know battles take place such as Marathon, Thermopylae and Salamis. Though some lesser known would also be fought, but just as, if not more important battles, Plataea, Mycale and Artemisium.

The Greeks would end up defeating the Persian invasions but this wouldn’t see the end of operations. The Persian threat still loomed large in their minds and measures were taken to strengthen themselves against any further invasions. This as we move forward in the series would have consequences shaping politics and relations as the years past.",ancientgreece

1626716554,A sophist walks into the Ecclesia....,"Herodotus, Book X: 

A sophist impious orator was preaching in the Ecclesia on Socrates, a known advocate of the Thirty Tyrants.

“Before my speech begins, you must get on your knees and praise Apollo for the Spartan constitution and accept that they were the most highly-evolved laws that Hellas has ever known, even greater than Athenian Democracy!”

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, Athenian champion who had served 30 summers sailing across the Aegean and understood the necessity of protecting the Laws and fully supported all military decision made by the Athenian demos stood up and held up a parchment.

“How old are these laws, Sophist?”

The arrogant philosopher smirked quite sardonically and smugly replied, “Merely a hundred years as they were invented by that rabblerouser Pericles who was inspired by Lycurgus.”

“Wrong. It’s been 220 years since Draco created them. If it was only a mere century years old and Lycurgus, as you say, inspired them... then the Ionian poleis would not be democratic as they are today.”

The Orator was visibly shaken, and dropped his copy of the Republic. He stormed out of the Ecclesia crying those sophist crocodile tears. The same tears oligarchists cry for the “nobles” (who today live in such luxury that most own at least 500 slaves) when they jealously try to claw and cut the wages of fleet-rowers and jurymen. There is no doubt that at this point our Philo““““““sopher”””””, Xenocrates, wished he had pulled himself up by his sandalstraps and become more than a sophist oligarchist orator. He wished so much that he had hemlock to poison himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!

The Athenian citizens applauded and held vote for the new elections of the Strategos that day and accepted Athenian democracy as their lord and savior. An owl named “Solon” flew into the room and perched atop the pillar where the laws were written and shed a tear on the wax. The laws were read several times, and Athena herself showed up and enacted the planning for the construction 100 triremes.

The sophist lost his citizenship and was ostracized the next day. He died of the plague sent to him by Apollo and was tossed into the river Styx for all eternity.",ancientgreece

1625385620,The Battle of Marathon - story snippet,"&amp;#x200B;

![img](ldf3nrimf5971 "" 'They are breaking, Nik!' he heard Hermogenes' exhausted shout on the left.
'Dress the line! Dress the line now!' Nikephoros bellowed over the deafening roar of battle.  He ripped his dory out of the shapeless heap of fallen bodies on the ground. It took all his remaining strength to just stand straight. Holding the aspis high enough to cover his chest suddenly seemed an impossible task.
The chaos was overwhelming. Dust covered everything, foes attacked from every angle. He managed to lift the shield on his shoulder, just in time to push back a pair of Sakai trying to cut him off from the phalanx. Two quick flashes flew around his helmet, first right, then left, and he felt, more than saw, his rear-ranker Bias quickly dispatching the two enemies.
'You owe me one,' he heard his friend's voice, even as he half-dragged him back into the line.
'More than I can count now...'
Suddenly, a great shout came from the far right: 'On my command. Two steps back!'
Somehow, Themistocles still held enough breath to make himself heard over the mad cacophony. And such was the power of his voice that the front lines started to form up, dragging their injured back, the epistatai hastily replacing fallen comrades in the first rank.
'Two steps back - and not a step more!' shouted  the strategos. 'Now!'
Nikephoros stepped closer to his friends, locking shields with Chalcon on his right and Hermogenes on the left. Behind him, he felt Bias' aspis. Courage surged back into the phalanx.
'Two more steps, lads. Nobody breaks!'
Together, the center of the line fell back, then again, locking together, reforming.
'Nobody runs! This is our land, Leontis! We shall not give it to them!'
"")

\*\*\*  


A little image description in form of a story snippet. The Battle of Marathon (490 BC) was actually not a flawless victory for the Greeks. The center of their line faced the Persian and Sakai elite regiments, and the tribes of Leontis and Antiochis almost broke there, encountering heavy casualties. I always found the 192 dead on the Athenian side (based on Herodotus) a little bit hard to believe 🙂

“We live under a form of government which does not emulate the institutions of our neighbours; on the contrary, we are ourselves a model which some follow, rather than the imitators of other peoples. It is true that our government is called a democracy, because its administration is in the hands, not of the few, but of the many; yet while as regards the law all men are on an equality for the settlement of their private disputes, as regards the value set on them it is as each man is in any way distinguished that he is preferred to public honours, not because he belongs to a particular class, but because of personal merits; nor, again, on the ground of poverty is a man barred from a public career by obscurity of rank if he but has it in him to do the state a service.”

1619633651,Song in the style of Ancient Greek music with Ancient Greek lyrics.,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovj9swmP2ZY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovj9swmP2ZY)

Hey everyone! I'm interested in ethnomusicology, and this is a song I composed following my research into Ancient Greek music--I took a poem by Callimachus (the poem is called Callimachus 2), and gave myself the goal of putting the words into a song that is as historically accurate as possible. Our understanding of Ancient Greek music is limited, but developed enough that we can have a generally accurate reconstruction.

The poem is by Callimachus (Καλλίμαχος) , c. 310/305–c. 240 BC, who was one of the most influential poets of the Hellenistic Age. He was also a librarian at the Library of Alexandria. This poem I used was dedicated to his friend, Heraclitus of Halicarnassus, another poet of the time. Hellenistic literature and poetry was in part defined by an interest in more everyday and mundane subjects, in contrast to prior eras' interest in great historical and mythological events. This poem is a good example of that--it's about Callimachus mourning the death of his friend.

I did my best to pronounce this as accurately as possible when singing--I employed reconstructed, Hellenistic era Koine pronunciation. I based the pronunciation mainly on Ioannis Stratakis' reading of the poem--he's a long time specialist in reading Ancient Greek texts. 

For the music, I used a reconstruction of the Kithara, that harp like instrument you've likely seen in many vases and visual representations. I then used a basic frame drum like those used in Ancient Greece, and cymbals, which were also used at the time. The melody uses musical modes that were in use back in the days of Ancient Greece, namely what we would today call the Double Harmonic Major and Aeolian modes. 

Something important to note is that Ancient Greeks linked emotions to certain scales--Aristotle in the *Politics* explains how certain *harmoniai* (musical moods) are tied to certain emotional states, and explains how the Phrygian musical mode was seen as full of excitement and adventure, or how the Dorian mode was seen as reflective and meditative. Therefore, following this idea, I decided to link the poem's emotional mood to musical modes that reflect the words. 

This is an important distinction to make with many types of music throughout the world. Middle-Eastern music, for example, is for the most part uninterested in ideas of mood or emotion--the melodies aren't necessarily meant to evoke feelings. Ancient Greek music, however, was all about pathos and the emotional state, thus why I used the Double Harmonic Major for the part of the poem that is very distraught, and the Aeolian for the part that is more sad, since it seems that the Greeks indeed chose certain musical modes for certain emotional moods. 

Another thing to note is the debate on whether Ancient Greek music was monophonic (all the instruments play the same melody without variation) or if there was harmony (the combination of one or two more notes) and polyphony (two or more independent melodies played at the same time). There's still debate on that; most academics seem to believe that Ancient Greek music was largely monophonic and based around simple melodies, but there's reason to believe that basic forms of harmony and polyphony did exist back then. (Plato, in ""Laws"", Book VII, Section 812d, advises learning musicians to simply play the exact same melody that their teacher plays in order to avoid the ""florid use of harmony,"" which means Greeks of the 5th century B.C did use the musical concept). 

Therefore, I played the first part of the song in a monophonic way: I sang a melody and played the exact same melody on the Kithara. The second part of the song gives us an idea of what harmonic Ancient Greek music would have been like: I added independent melodies alongside the main melody in order to ornament it. Keep in mind that this second version, the ornamented one with harmony and polyphony, is the more controversial one, and most academicians would generally prefer the former, simpler monophonic form of the song as the more historically accurate one.

All in all, this isn't going to be an exact replica of how Greek music from the Hellenistic Age would have sounded--it's impossible to get it exactly right since our knowledge of the era's music is limited, but this should be a generally accurate if imperfect attempt at capturing the sound of Ancient Greece :)",ancientgreece
1619614288,"Rotunda of Galerius, Thessaloniki/GREECE"," 

The oldest monument in Thessaloniki, the **Rotunda** (also known as **Agios Georgios**) is a massive round building that was first a Roman mausoleum, then a Christian church, then a mosque. Its interior is decorated with Early Christian mosaics; outside is the city’s only surviving minaret.

The Rotunda was built by the Roman emperor Galerius (**305-11**) as part of a large palace complex in Thessaloniki. It was probably intended to be his mausoleum, but it was never used as such. The Rotunda of Galerius was converted into a Christian church in the late 4th century or mid-5th century. The **date** of conversion to a church has been difficult to determine with any certainty. There is no written documentation about the event, so dating has to be based on analysis of the style of the mosaics and the historical situation of Thessaloniki in these early centuries. 

hessaloniki flourished, and developed at a fast pace into the mid-6th century.

In the assembly of the municipality (ecclesia), where he initially tried to speak twice, he did not succeed, because he was hindered by his nervousness and the difficulty in pronouncing ""L"" and ""R"". This humiliation hurt him, but he did not give up.

Demosthenes the stutterer, as his stepmother used to call him, with his faith and perseverance, going daily to Faliro (a local beach) and reading difficult texts with his mouth full of pebbles accompanied by the sound of the waves, managed to face his  disability and the nervousness caused by this weakness.

Historically this was the first attempt to deal with stuttering and Demosthenes in this way, his faith and perseverance managed to realize his dream and become the most important orator of antiquity and all times.  Never give up, there is always a way ..

Ancient Olympia was established in Greece as the most important religious and sports center. Here were born the most important games of ancient Greece, the Olympics, which took place every four years in honor of Zeus, an institution with pan-Hellenic radiance and brilliance from antiquity to the present day.

According to UNESCO, there is no archeological site in the whole world with such a close reference to the current reality as in Olympia.

The archeological site of Olympia includes the Sanctuary of Zeus, Altis, the sanctuary grove, the Stoa of Echo, which separates the sanctuary from the stadium.

1618439838,Why do all historical fiction novels set during the Trojan War always tread the same ground?,"It seems to me that most historical fiction, books but also media, regarding the Trojan War alway either try to retell or subvert the same portions of the Trojan War myth that everyone knows.  And frankly, as someone who has read most of not all the original material, it comes off as nowhere near as entertaining as the original source material.  They always make the Trojan War seem smaller in scale than the original poems did, and authors usually rush to the major points that have already been expertly told by superior poets and authors from another time.
I guess my big question is, have any authors attempted to focus their stories on sections of the story or myth that are known but the original material is lost?  For example the Aethiopis, little Iliad, etc.?  I always thought there’s a ton of potentially great characters and arcs that you’d think an author would love having the freedom to explore and tell stories in, without being worried their work would be compared to their ancient, titanic counterparts.

1613231821,Did the mythical city of Troy really exist?,"Some 3000 years ago, the ancient Greek poet Homer popularized the Trojans and their ill-fated city in his powerful epic, *The Iliad.* The poems tell the story of a decade long war between Greece and Troy, fought by such timeless characters as Achilles and Hector. The verses speak of epic romance, sheer cunning, and tragic consequences.

While some have argued that Troy was a myth, others believe in the existence of the city. So is Troy more than just a tale? If it is, where does it exist today? And what led to its’ destruction?

1612202834,Pheidias – The Great Ancient Greek Sculptor,"  

Phidias/Pheidias, (c. 490–430 BCE), was an Athenian sculptor and the artistic director of the construction of the Parthenon, who created its most important religious images and supervised and probably designed its overall sculptural decoration. 

Little is known about Phidias’s life. When Pericles rose to power in 449, he initiated a great building program in Athens and placed Phidias in charge of all artistic undertakings. Among works for which Phidias is famous are three monuments to Athena on the Athenian Acropolis (the Athena Promachos, the Lemnian Athena, and the colossal Athena Parthenos for the Parthenon) and the colossal seated Zeus for the Temple of Zeus at Olympia; none of these survives in the original.

The colossal statue of the Athena Parthenos (a representation of this statue you can see in the photo), which Phidias made for the Parthenon, was completed and dedicated in 438. The original work was made of gold and ivory and stood some 38 feet (12 metres) high. The goddess stood erect, wearing a tunic, aegis, and helmet and holding a Nike (goddess of victory) in her extended right hand and a spear in her left. A decorated shield and a serpent were by her side. Several copies have been identified from this description; among them are the Varakion, a Roman copy of about 130 CE (now in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens), and a Hellenistic copy, from about 160 BCE, made for the main hall of the royal library at Pergamum (now in the Staatliche Museen Preussischer Kulturbesitz in Berlin).

Phidias’s last years remain a mystery. Pericles’ enemies accused Phidias of stealing gold from the statue of the Athena Parthenos in 432, but he was able to disprove the charge. They then accused him of impiety (for including portraits of Pericles and himself on the shield of Athena on the Athena Parthenos), and he was thrown into prison. Until recently, it was thought that Phidias died in prison shortly thereafter, but now it is believed that he was exiled to Elis, where he worked on the Olympian Zeus. A “workroom,” thought to be Phidias’s, has been found in Olympia. 

Phidias and his assistants were also responsible for the marble sculptures that adorned the Parthenon. Most of these remains (the Elgin Marbles) are now in the British Museum.",ancientgreece

I was trying to figure out the name of a holiday taking place in ancient Greece (possibly Rome?). I read about it once in a book I now forget the name of. Anyway, the holiday was a celebration of women. It might've gone on for a couple days, but the main gist was that men were not allowed outside at certain times of the day/throughout the day, and women were free to do more than they were usually able to. It might've also taken place during a time when a lot of political decisions were being made for they year. I explicitly remember a scene in the story where an older man is warned that he may be killed by the women if he remained outside, especially during the night.

&amp;#x200B;

Together they guide us into an obscure but important aspect of not just the Late Bronze Age but of the Bronze Age Collapse itself and that is the subject of piracy.

&amp;#x200B;

Are the Sea Peoples merely pirates or is it more complicated?

&amp;#x200B;

What does archaeology tell us about piracy in the Late Bronze Age?

&amp;#x200B;

Were there pirate kings and pirate kingdoms?

&amp;#x200B;

Do we have primary sources on piracy in the Late Bronze Age? Can the Iliad and the Odyssey be taken as a historical source and do these works reflect Bronze Age piracy?

&amp;#x200B;

Why were the Sea Peoples easily defeated in open battle? 

&amp;#x200B;

These are just a few of the subjects that we attack in this fun episode on the Sea Peoples, Piracy and the Bronze Age Collapse.

1610826618,"Were the priesthoods of various Greek gods qualitatively different? Were the priests who served in a Temple of Ares more prone to violence, or priests of Apollo especially likely to be lovers of the arts?","To the modern mind, it’s easy to imagine the priests of a polytheistic religion like that of Ancient Greece to be mini-avatars of their patrons’ ideals. 

Someone who dedicates themselves specifically to Ares seems likely value violence and aggression, while a servant of Aphrodite might be more openly sexual and interested in beauty. One can easily imagine the priests of Dionysus throwing wild parties, while the priests of Athena might be more stern and disciplined. Apollo was the god of music and the arts, so did priests of Apollo have a more artistic streak than those in a temple dedicated to Poseidon?

Obviously such priests were human and it’s impossible to categorically describe them as a unit. But is there any indication that temples dedicated to specific gods attracted particular types of people, or that their rites and rituals encouraged different patterns of behavior based on the god they served?

Or is that a false assumption from a modern perspective, and ancient priests were not differentiated in that way from temple to temple and god to god?",ancientgreece

This episode touches on a variety of points including:

&amp;#x200B;

Historical parallels with Nazi Germany, Mussolini's Italy and the 1934 crisis of France.

&amp;#x200B;

The evolution of modern extremists groups as they attempt to co-opt other conservative banners, flags and images while moving away from controversial hate symbols such as the swastika which can be a turn off to patriotic conservatives.

&amp;#x200B;

Populism and conspiracy theories from the Bronze Age to our present day and attempts by modern politicians to pretend to be populists, manipulate their followers while very much being globalists.

&amp;#x200B;

The holocaust and modern antisemitism as it manifested itself at these riots and attacks on our federal government. And the parallels that we are seeing with not just the Third Reich as the fringe becomes mainstream but the problems surrounding entertainment news and media who in many ways are going down the path of public broadcasting that we saw leading up to the genocide in Rwanda.

&amp;#x200B;

The appropriation, misuse, abuse and misunderstanding of Spartan, Viking / Norse History and Native American History / Culture and how it manifested itself in D.C during the protests and criminal actions that took place.

The kings of Epirus claimed descent from Neoptolemus, and Pyrrhus' father was called Neoptolemus II.

1608754651,"Zeus, the Demon-God, Brought Winter to the Pelasgians","In studying the legend of Cadmus I have discovered something I find fascinating. Cadmus is credited with bringing writing to Greece and is said to be Phoenician. Thus he is often placed around 800 BC or so by many classical Greeks and later historians. However Herodotus says Cadmus lived 16 centuries before his own time - or 2000 BC - which is long before the Phoenicians came to Greece. We know the Minoans are using linear A by 1800 BC and we have found linear A tablets on mainland greece from shortly after this time period. This is very close to Herodotus' estimation. It could also be referencing Cretan hieroglyphics coming to Greece around 2000 BC but that is more speculative. Therefore, Cadmus is likely much older than many later Greeks believed...and Herodotus might actually have access to special knowledge here that makes his dating a bit more accurate than others. He was after all a member of the Samothrace Cult of the Great Gods, who worshiped the same Earth Mother that Cadmus did.

You see....  (takes deep breath)

Cadmus begins his tale in search of his sister Europa, who has been abducted by Zeus. Europe being conquered by Zeus? Well, we do know that indo-europeans came into Greece around 2000-1900 BC and their primary deity was the sky, which will evolve into Zeus (Dyeu = Sky in indo-european). If Cadmus is Minoan, they would likely see themselves as a sister society to the Pelasgians, and I can see Cadmus as a Minoan hero come ashore to save his fellow Earth Mother goddess worshipers (a Pelasgian version of Gaia or Demeter was likely the primary deity of both Minoans and Pelasgians). There is a lot of Goddess and Sky symbolism in the legend of Cadmus. His reign is said to be unstable. The kingship of Thebes is even lost twice after Cadmus. First to a local nobleman, then to twin 'sons of Zeus'. Thus we get a picture of a tenuous hold on power for the Cadmeian line where they are caught between local nobles representing the old guard and old ways, and the new coming indo-european sky worshipers.

Cadmus lands at Samothrace, where the oracle of the Earth Mother stood (even into Christian times btw...and Herodotus was a member of this cult). He asks the oracles aid but she tells him there is no hope, Europa belongs to the sky now. She then directs him on his actual destiny to become king of Thebes.

Cadmus' legend mirrors that of the later Greek legend of Persephone, daughter of the 'earth mother' goddess Demeter who is carried away to the underworld by Hades, causing Demeter to weep and bring winter. Before Zeus overthrew the Titans and established he and his Olympians as the head gods, he is said to have dwelled in the underworld for a time. Could the Greeks actually be retelling an ancient Pelasgian legend in which they and Zeus are actually the villains that abduct/conquer Europe, bringing her to 'the underworld' and causing the Earth Mother to weep, bringing winter to the Pelasgians and eventually the Minoans?  


I made a video about Cadmus if anyone wants to check it out:

I was wondering why the english language in particular is so weird with ancient names. I can only compare it with what i know, Dutch, so maybe other languages do the same as english. If so, please enlighten me.

But, for example, why do english speakers say 'Homer, Livy, aristotle, circe', instead of 'Homeros, livius, Aristoteles and Kirke'? It just seems kind of weird to me. Is it just that these words dont sound quite right in english, so that's why they made an ""english friendly"" version of the name?

I'm designing a school project on the topic of Greek Pottery for secundary school students. They are around 15 years old and they are taking an introduction class on ancient classical cultures. I know this might be a long shot, but does anybody here have any idea on how to do it? I'm open to all kind of suggestions! 


For now, this is what I have thought:
- I would like to exhibit this project on the school hall, to maximize visibility.
- As we won't have too much time, I will give an initial presentation on the topic: the different shapes and uses, the motifs and all that.
- The students will draw the motiffs and images on some cheap terracotta flower plates 
- The students will use some playdoh to show the variety of shapes Greek pottery has and make some visual presentation on those shapes (with text and drawings, maybe?).


With this project (and a few others) I want to lure a few students to take ancient Greek classes next year, so wish me the best of luck!

1606327912,Mycenaean ruins and Homer,"Imagine you're a typical, illiterate Greek peasant living right after the conclusion of the Dark Ages around 6-C BC. The ruins of Mycenaean palaces are just an ordinary part of your landscape, but you know nothing about them. You're listening to the bard(s) sing about Agamemnon and Helen. Do you connect the material culture and the songs? Do you suppose the songs rose out of the material culture?

I've read plenty of scholars who suggest that Homeric epic may have 'memories' of Mycenaean Greece, and that's interesting and everything, but I'm wondering about the actual giant hulks of stone and whether they become part of legend and history.

How do you think the raw physicality of these ruins changed, influenced, or contributed to the formation and reception of the epics?",ancientgreece

It has become really long, with multiple different angles taken, and multiple discussions raising and falling. But both me and Doctor Lao are failing in the crucial area of not being to well read of the actual period and the litterateur of Plato. I have read some of his dialogues and some scholars work on the subject and he has degrees in anthropology, comparative religion and mycology. So, it would be amazing if anyone of you could take a look of what we have done and set us straight if it is something that is completely of rails. Especially if you are interested in the subject as we are. I know it is a hard conversation to get into and there is a lot of pretty bonkers twists and turns to digest but I hope it is interesting enough to be worth while for you.

1604948092,Molon Labe and White Supremacism : The most famous phrase never to be spoken ~ Dr. Owen Rees.,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

DID LEONIDAS SAY “MOLŌN LABE” AT THE BATTLE OF THERMOPYLAE?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

CLAIM : When Xerxes’ demanded for the Greeks at Thermopylae to lay down their weapons, Leonidas defiantly replied molōn labe.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""MOLŌN LABE"" the epic phrase most likely never said.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In this video Dr. Owen Rees guides us through the history and historiography of Molon Labe,"" by discussing the sources, the variations of the story and how it evolved over time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But more importantly Dr. Rees touches on the appropriation of this phrase and other aspects of Spartan / Ancient History by modern day white supremacists and other political radicals.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He talks about the dangers of this appropriation as people are easily lead from moderate political stances by these appropriations and misconstructions into often radically dangerous groups.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The evidence for Leonidas defiantly declaring molōn labe to Xerxes is very weak. It does not appear in any near-contemporary accounts of the battle, it does not appear in a historical work about the battle, and it receives its first surviving mention by Plutarch in the first or early second century AD. When it is finally mentioned by Plutarch, it is not a verbal conversation using envoys, but an anachronistic-sounding exchange of letters. For this reason we have deemed this claim to be mostly false: it does appear in an ancient source, but that source appears almost 500 years after the battle.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And so with that being said we have to ask ourselves, why did a Greco-Roman historian want to revision the past? And why do modern radicals still attempt to misconstrue history while screaming and tattooing phrases that were never said?

&amp;#x200B;

Although the rectangular white marble Parthenon has suffered damage over the centuries, including the loss of most of its sculpture, its basic structure has remained intact. 

Ancient ruins like the Parthenon can teach us about the past in a unique way. Through architectural remains, we can gather what building techniques and civilizations were like long ago. Even so, ruins can’t compare to the real deal, and historical reconstructions of these architectural wonders are key to a fuller understanding of the cultures that created them.

The trade to Egypt through the Nile allowed the transfer of knowledge and people like Socrates, Pythagoras, Aristotle had visited Egypt.  The three civilizations where science and mathematics had developed early and had great practical uses were **Egypt, Babylonia, Greek**. Greeks were the last to join, but they developed theorems from ideas and mathematical tools which were in use in Babylonia, Egypt. 
*  The Babylonians had developed arithmetical methods of solving problems. Astronomy was a vital part of the Babylonian culture as **they worshipped planetary gods like Greeks**
*  **The first scientist is accepted to be Thales of Miletus.** He might have learned a lot from the Babylonians and Egyptians as his origin is not clear. Later he established mathematics in Greek science and converted mathematics from Babylonia where it got used only as a tool to a part of science itself. The Babylonians also knew about Pythagoras theorem, which got discovered at the same time. 
* The ***Greeks descended from the collapse of an ancient civilization known as Mycenaean***. After the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization, the dark age was upon them for two centuries. The Mycenaeans left only stories and poems about gods that got passed to the Greeks, and that is the reason why their religion is a collection of fairy tales that partially reflects the values and theologies of Mycenaeans. . 
*  One of the primary methods of reasoning which the Greeks followed is as follows “***if all men are mortal; if Socrates is a man; then Socrates is a mortal”***.

1600540658,The Bronze Age Collapse in the Hebrew Bible by Seth Fleishman.," 

In this episode Seth Fleishman from the YouTube Channel ""World History By A Jew,"" takes us into a subject I have really looked forward to and that is the Bronze Age Collapse in the Bible.

In this lecture he explores the Old Testament and shows us the Bronze Age Collapse throughout the Hebrew Bible, while also exploring the world outside of it as well such as explaining what was happening in Egypt, Greece, Anatolia and Canaan, while also discussing many of the sites that were destroyed by the Sea Peoples themselves.

But, we also see those of the Sea Peoples who arrive to ancient Canaan and who also decide to stay such as the Philistines. But also he discusses a controversial subject and that is, is one of the Israelite Tribes part of the Sea Peoples groups?

And we also ask ourselves, how does the Hebrew Bible stand up to history? Can we use it as a historical resource and what should we keep in mind while studying literature and histories that were a major aspect of creating an ancient Israelite identity?

1600451354,Philistine Society in Ancient Canaan ~ Dr. Aren Maeir," 

In this episode Dr. Maeir guides us through Philistine Society and what little bit of information that we know about them.

Was it a hierarchical society? Is their societal structure due to their relationship to Greece? Are there problems with this hypothesis?

What was the relationship between Philistine cities? Were they separate or united? Was Inter-Philistine Competition? Were the Philistines truly a militaristic society?

It also deals with the lack of textual evidence and also brings up the problematic portrayals of the Philistines in ancient Israelite texts like the Bible.

The Philistines were an ancient people who lived on the south coast of Canaan from the 12th century BC until 604 BC, when they were exiled to Mesopotamia by King Nebuchadnezzar II. They are known for their biblical conflict with the Israelite's. Though the primary source of information about the Philistines is the Hebrew Bible, they are first attested to in reliefs at the Temple of Ramses III at Medinet Habu, in which they are called Peleset (accepted as cognate with Hebrew Peleshet); the parallel Assyrian term is Palastu, Pilišti, or Pilistu.

As should be obvious from the title, I'm considering trying to (initially) read them through, beginning to end, without consulting the notes. Is this something you would advise to yourself if you had to learn Herodotus and Thucydides from scratch again? For a first time reader, are the notes necessary to having a working understanding of the texts by the time you read the end page, or would they hinder more than they help, and are better for second readings or for when a reader what an in-depth understanding of specific passages?

A moving, powerful journey deep into the oldest music in the Western world, guided by the eccentric musicologist who has dedicated his life to understanding &amp; preserving it. An immersive sonic &amp; visual feast that leaves the viewer feeling they've looked into a way of life that the 21st century has left behind. A call to arms for a different way of listening to music, understanding humanity and living as a community.

The world’s oldest mourning song, the mirologi unchanged in the mountain villages of Zagoria, a part of the ancient Greek province of Epirus, close by the Albanian border.  
For three days every year, an unceasing festival of song is held there, its purpose: to heal life’s wounds for all who hear it and dance to it. For one man, it became a path from death, back into life.

“Love your life, and live it, but remember the dead, and that you won’t always be here.”

The music of Epirus is played so that people can dance to it, drink and be transported from their troubles, while also remembering their loved ones who have passed on.

A moving, powerful journey deep into the oldest music in the Western world, guided by the eccentric musicologist who has dedicated his life to understanding &amp; preserving it. An immersive sonic &amp; visual feast that leaves the viewer feeling they've looked into a way of life that the 21st century has left behind. A call to arms for a different way of listening to music, understanding humanity and living as a community.

The world’s oldest mourning song, the mirologi unchanged in the mountain villages of Zagoria, a part of the ancient Greek province of Epirus, close by the Albanian border.  
For three days every year, an unceasing festival of song is held there, its purpose: to heal life’s wounds for all who hear it and dance to it. For one man, it became a path from death, back into life.

“Love your life, and live it, but remember the dead, and that you won’t always be here.”

The music of Epirus is played so that people can dance to it, drink and be transported from their troubles, while also remembering their loved ones who have passed on.

""An incredibly enjoyable melodic odyssey, Paul Duane's endlessly curious film travels to Greece searching for the oldest music in the western world.""

""There's a magnificent match cut at an early juncture of While You Live, Shine -- from a microscopic view of the grooves in the 78 RPM record supplying the film's soundtrack to the craggy landscape of the Greek mountains from which the music comes--that demonstrates in an instant this wonderful documentary's innate understanding of the power of art to transport us.""

1598711857,New Chronology by Dr. David Rohl," 

New Chronology is an alternative chronology of the ancient Near East developed by English Egyptologist David Rohl and other researchers beginning with A Test of Time: The Bible - from Myth to History in 1995. 

It contradicts mainstream Egyptology by proposing a major revision of the established Egyptian chronology, in particular by re-dating Egyptian kings of the Nineteenth through Twenty-fifth Dynasties, bringing forward conventional dating by up to 350 years. 

David Rohl's published works A Test of Time (1995), Legend (1998), The Lost Testament (2002), and The Lords of Avaris (2007) set forth Rohl's theories for re-dating the major civilizations of the ancient world. A Test of Time proposes a down-dating (bringing closer to the present), by several centuries, of the New Kingdom of Egypt, thus needing a major revision of the conventional chronology of ancient Egypt. 

Rohl asserts that this would let scholars identify some of the major events in the Hebrew Bible with events in the archaeological record and identify some of the well-known biblical characters with historical figures who appear in contemporary ancient texts. Lowering the Egyptian dates also dramatically affects the dating of dependent chronologies, such as that currently used for the Greek Heroic Age of the Late Bronze Age, removing the Greek Dark Ages, and lowering the dates of the Trojan War to within two generations of a ninth-century-BC Homer and his most famous composition: the Iliad.

The New Chronology, one of several proposed radical revisions of the conventional chronology, has not been accepted in academic Egyptology, where the conventional chronology or small variations of it remains standard.

Furthermore, would there be any sort of chronology to these plays? Any general order in which they’d take place, as if they were a sort of episodic series?

On a regional level, for those who grow up in the Chicago area, Lake Michigan forms the right edge of the map, and what lies on the lake's eastern shore is rarely if ever thought about.

Do we have evidence for how ancient Greeks, let's say prior to Alexander, viewed the ""Greek World?""   

Would they have placed the Greek mainland in the center of the map, the Adriatic on the left, and the Aegean on the right, or would the Aegean have been the center of their map, with the mainland on the left and the western part of Asia minor on the right?  Were Ionia, Lesbos, and Rhodes considered part of their everyday geographic sphere, or were they off the right edge of the map, so to speak?

We know the Greeks were aware of the larger world, but I'm curious as to how they mentally oriented themselves as far as things like everyday trade and politics.

Seneca talked about it in the ninth letter to lucilius, in which he talked about stilbione that says “omnia mea mecum porto”. then I was thinking of writing about the dusculos, in the 5th act sostrato has a speech about the material assets, I know that plutarch has similar ideas to seneca. 
do you have any advice? what work should I mention? which part? 
my idea is to say that happiness doesn’t come from material assets. If you have any idea for a title it would be nice.

1590095863,Language in Franco Rossi's Odissea 1968,"What is the original non dubbed language of this film? Are all of the actors speaking their native language? 

I didn't know where else to ask this question and I figured that most of this subreddit would have seen the film, considered by many to be the finest representation of Homeric Greece in cinema. If not I thoroughly recommend it, a full 4 part 8 hour version with English subs can be found on Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjN\_merCA0Q&amp;t=2129s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjN_merCA0Q&amp;t=2129s) 

It's a magnificent film but I cannot make heads or tales of the dubs. I've been looking about on various corners of the internet to little avail.  I know it's an Italian, Yugoslavian, German and French joint production, and has several actors from other countries including the incomparable  Ειρήνη Παππάς. The Italian wiki claims that the original language of the film was Italian, but all of the Italian versions I have found are dubbed. If indeed all of the actors are speaking their native language, can an undubbed multinlingual version be found? Any recommendations of a definitive version would be enormously appreciated.

1589838667,Nietzsche's Dionysian and real life Greeks,"I presume that more than a few historians in this subreddit are familiar with Nietzsche's extremely influential notions of Apollonian and Dionysian. (They were after all one of his most enduring contributions to philosophy.) Upon reading his firstborn The Birth of Tragedy, one would feel reasonably justified in seeing the two notions loosely mapping to Freud's more famous notions of life and death drive. Indeed, Nietzsche offers a certain primacy to Dionysian, the same way late Freud does to death drive, in a move which shocked many of his most ardent followers, let alone general public. Nevertheless, upon further acquaintance with Nietzsche (and Freud, mind you), it is increasingly clear that no matter how strikingly similar their respective philosophies of drive/desire/will (or should one say meta-psychologies) are in many a respect, their overall outlook is decidedly different. Nietzsche would accuse Freud of being ahistorical and blind to the profound historical catastrophe brought about by the victory of slave morality, and Freud would probably for his part accuse Nietzsche of wishful thinking: I am saying it how it is, unlike you who try to endow Man with loftiness and vitalism of which he knows not. You are way too smart and profound to sincerely believe in that wasteful and creative desire stemming from superabundance and inner loftiness. It is precisely this point of contention that has preoccupied my thoughts for quite some time. While I wish I could side with Nietzsche, I cannot help but consider Freud's account more in accordance with the state of things. But then again, my impressions may be rather skewed due to me being a human of late capitalism. Which brings me to my question. The late Nietzsche effectively and decisively moved away from his early artist's metaphysics to naturalism and Apollo had vanished from his writings. The opposition between the two is merely dialectical, it was always Dionysian monism and nothing else. He writes (I'm quoting from memory): Saying Yes to Life even in its strangest and hardest problems, the will to Life rejoicing in its inexhaustability even in the sacrifice of its highest types, that is what I called Dionysian, that is what I guessed to be the bridge towards the psychology of the tragic poet. Not in order to be liberated from terror and pity [...] but in order to be oneself the eternal joy of becoming. Dionysian now stands for, how should I put it, the indestructibility of life and world-affirming, rapturous superabundance which cannot help but squander itself in excesses. Was he projecting onto Greeks something which had never been there in the first place or was his legendary intuition onto something remarkable?",ancientgreece

1587436697,Possible Mycenean Influence in Northern Germany,"So, I've recently been reading up on the Bronze Age and it's subsequent collapse.  I just finished Eric Cline's "" 1177 BC"" and loved it.  Looking for my next book on Amazon I came across what may be considered more or less ""Pseudo-Archaeology"" books regarding the placement of the Trojan War not in the Aegean, but Baltic Sea.

The idea may be a little far fetched, and Im not entirely on board myself, but some further digging did bring up some interesting things I didn't know of or even consider regarding Bronze Age Germany and northern Europe.  Such as the mysterious battle of Tollense Valley, chariot warfare, hilled Military forts in the area and the appearance of a lot of Bronze and Tin items and tools in the area a lot sooner than Archaeologists would at first believe.

So, what I'm curious about is exactly how much interaction did the Germans, Danes, Norwegians, etc have with the Myceneans, Egyptians and Anatolians of the Bronze Age.  Apparently more than we'd think given the weapons and tools they had available to them.  How could have these interactions taken place?  Possible conquests and raids by the Mediterranean Bronze Age Cultures? Trade?  How much archaeological evidence do we have of the civilizations coming in contact?

If there are any experts on the subject or if anyone could recommend any good or reliable sources such as lectures or books/essays on the subject I'd love to further my research.  I find the mystery of it all very fascinating.",ancientgreece

This follows the spread of tales from Egypt to the Greek World and what role mercenaries played in spreading these tales. 

Primary Argument Presented: That Mercenaries served as an overlooked conduit for technology transfers and tales, connecting not only the ""civilized"" Ancient Near East Mediterranean but also the ""Barbarian"" periphery.

This lecture deals with these main points:

(1) Uluburun and possible Northern connections.

(2) Review of the use of mercenaries in the Ancient Near East Mediterranean.

(3) Mycenaean and possible European military presence in New Kingdom Egypt.

(4) Similar tales or common originals?

1587146990,The Bronze Age Collapse and the Onomasticon of Amenope,"The Onomastica of Amenope contains a word list for groups of things varying from the list of what is contained in the heavens, to the towns of Egypt, to the parts of an oxen and its kind of meat. It is generally accepted that the Onomastica of Amenope dates to the late Twentieth Dynasty and is known from at least ten copies or fragment versions on papyrus, a writing board, a strip of leather, and several potsherds.

The Onomastica was used for administrative purposes but was also used for teaching scribes. Gardiner’s translation of the Onomastica is widely consulted, and its excellence has in some ways discouraged other scholars from studying the Onomastica. The most important section for our purposes is chapter 4, which lists the class, tribes, and types of human beings in the region. In this listing there are many references to the tribes of the Sea Peoples (Simpson 2001: 605).

The Onomasticon of Amenope, or Amenemipit (amen-em-apt), gives a slight credence to the idea that the Ramesside kings settled the Sea Peoples in Canaan. Dated to about 1100 BCE, at the end of the 21st dynasty (which had numerous short-reigned pharaohs), this document simply lists names.

After six place names, four of which were in Philistia, the scribe lists the Sherden (Line 268), the Tjeker (Line 269) and the Peleset (Line 270), who might be presumed to occupy those cities. The Story of Wenamun on a papyrus of the same cache also places the Tjeker in Dor at that time.

The fact that the Biblical maritime Tribe of Dan was initially located between the Philistines and the Tjekker, has prompted some to suggest that they may originally have been Denyen. Sherden seem to have been settled around Megiddo and in the Jordan Valley, and Weshwesh (connected by some with the Biblical tribe of Asher) may have been settled further north.

I know the league is often likened to an Athenian Empire, as they took taxes etc from the states and eventually forced them to remain in the 'alliance' through force, but how did Athens actually control the states politically? E.G. In Rome, there were governors for each province that held legal/official control, and for each province there were treaties etc stating what they had given up when they were conquered. Was there any equivalent in the 'Athenian Empire'? I know the Roman Empire was much, much bigger than the Athenian Empire so would have used more administration anyway, but I guess I'm asking whether the power of the 'Empire' was anything more than the Athenians stealing money from other cities on the pretence of taxes. Were the Athenians bothered with the politics of the member states?

Specially, after Sparta is Past it’s prime and suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Thebes. Three follows, well, three helots. They’ve accidentally killed their master and now they’re on the run. A band of 300 Spartan warriors have been assembled to hunt them down. Three is often referred to as the anti-300, because it takes a more historically accurate view of Sparta. It has fantastically impeccable research.

There is geographical evidence, Herodotus (The father of History) famously showed it on a map, and it's existence is spoke about in Plato's Timaeus and Critias. There is something called the eye of the Sahara, that I strongly suggest you google. And it was said that it was right below the Atlas mountains. (Which are real) and you can look it up.
.
If you say yes, and believe it's underwater, or you say no, I strongly recommend watching Bright Insights YouTube video on Atlantis. I promise you you'll gain a new perspective on Atlantis. Even if you already believe it existed.
.
And if his video isn't enough to convince you, he made a second video on it, and adding to the evidence.
.
Besides, ancient city's have disappeared before without leaving any materialistic evidence behind. And ancient civilizations have disappeared without a trace before. Infact, we don't know how many have disappeared without a trace. We literally couldn't. That's the point of leaving without a trace. For all we know, there could have been an extra 200 civilizations that existed that we we don't and never will know about. So there's not much rational reason to believe Atlantis is an exception.

So I have one question. Since I'm not well versed in Greek history, and onlineresearch has proven vague, I was wondering if Spartan women were allowed to be soldiers? I know that Sparta had more freedom for women, but I'm curious as to how far, and if AC Odyssey got it right?",ancientgreece
1586009980,Plague in the ancient and medieval world.,"The word 'plague', in defining a lethal epidemic, was coined by the physician Galen (l. 130-210 CE) who lived through the Antonine Plague (165 - c. 180/190 CE) but the disease was recorded long before in relating the affliction of the Plague of Athens (429-426 BCE) which killed many of the city’s inhabitants, including the statesman Pericles (l. 495-429 BCE). This epidemic, and some of the others that followed, may or may not have been actual plague as it was later defined; ancient writers tended to use the term plague for any widespread outbreak of pestilence.

Plagues certainly may have existed prior to the Athenian outbreak – and almost certainly did – but most studies of the epidemic begin with Athens as it is the first recorded by an eyewitness and survivor, the historian Thucydides (l. 460/455 - 399/398 BCE). Plagues are routinely named either for the person who reported them, the monarch at the time of the outbreak, the region afflicted, or by an epithet as in the case of the Black Death.

1585830362,In what ways is Greece so influential?,"All of us have heard that Greece is the 'cradle of western civilization' and I didn't think much of it until I started getting deeper into history and more importantly into the history of philosophy.

It is actually incredible just how influential Ancient Greece was. From essentially founding philosophy and biology they also really set the pace for mathematics, physics, medicine and many other disciplines.

Then you look into the Roman Empire and how much they took from the Greeks, then the founding fathers of Christianity how much they incorporated from Plato and Aristotle as well. Furthermore, even the theory of atoms (albeit much different) began in Greece as well as what we later learned about the cosmos through Copernicus.

The fact that Alexander the Great conquered half of the known world that mixed the west and the east and really brought very directly the culture that we even have to this day.

So what are some ways that you know Ancient Greece played a part that changed history dramatically and why do you see it as a cradle of civilization?",ancientgreece

1585411932,"Silver, Ships, Olives, and Mercenaries: Contacts Between Egypt and the Greek World (1600-1200 B.C) by Doctor Jorrit Kelder.","Connections between Ancient Egypt and the Mycenaean world have often been understood in terms of indirect exchange, via middlemen on Cyprus and in the Levant. 

This view is mainly informed by the relative paucity of Mycenaean pottery found in Egypt, especially when compared to the large amounts of Mycenaean pottery found on Cyprus and the Levant. 

It will be argued in this presentation that connections between Egypt and Mycenae were of direct, diplomatic nature and that various different missions can be identified over the course of the 15th to 13th centuries BC. 

To prove this belief, the lecture presents a range of archaeological, iconographical and textual evidence coming both from Egypt and the Mycenaean world.

Athens is obvious (though lesser-known recommendations within Athens are welcome), and Sparta seems to be a given as well.  But where else would you visit if you had 9 days in Greece to explore the Classical Age?  Would you hit the big cities like Corinth and Thebes?  Or are there some smaller sites that are really worth the effort?  I'm interested in the big monumental-type ruins of course, but I'm also--and perhaps more-so--interested in sites that show how regular people lived and got on, ways to really immerse myself in what it was like to be there.  Any lodging, food, or transportation recommendations in those locations are also much appreciated.  Thanks a lot.",ancientgreece

Scion, for those unaware, is a tabletop rpg about mythology, where the player characters are so called Scions, people who have a scrap of divine power from a particular god in them that they can use to perform great heroic feats and such. The game's default setting is a modern times ""All myths are true"" setting, but it can do historical campaigns taking place in the past just as easily. The game has a selection of different pantheons to choose from, and one is greco-roman, so inspired by playing a little Assassin's Creed Odyssey and the recently released Theros block of Magic The Gathering, I decided to do a slightly high fantasy-ish campaign of the game taking place in a version of ancient Greece where all myths are true, and of course with all player characters being scions of the Greek pantheon exclusively. I love Greek mythology but know very little about Greek history, so I was looking for a bit of help, namely two questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Just generally, what advice would you give to not make the world be some caricature of Grecian historical stereotypes?
2. What specific time period of Grecian history would you recommend this game take place in? Why? Are there any ideas for stories that you can think of based on the historical context at the time?

I'm currently working on Herodotus' queens for my master' thesis.

But my main struggle is that i can't find a good question/sentence and a good structure to put my ideas cleverly on the paper. I have a lot of connections to make between the queens but i have no idea on how i could present them. 

So i decided to post here (my very first post on reddit !) to see if maybe anyone of you guys could help me just by giving me tips on how to write it, what question i could ask, or to find some other connections that i still haven't found... So far i still can't figure if Herodotus wrote the queens this way to show a single idea in the background of the Histories, or if we just can't connect some queens.

Then from the yoke loosed their war-steeds sweating, and each by his chariot
Tethered his horses with thongs. And then they brought from the city,
Hastily, oxen and goodly sheep; and wine honey-hearted
Gave them, . . . and corn from the houses.
Firewood they gathered withal; and then from the plain to the heavens
Rose on the winds the sweet savor. And these by the highways of battle
Hopeful sat through the night, and many their watchfires burning
Even as when in the sky the stars shine out round the night-orb,
Wondrous to see, and the winds are laid, and the peaks and the headlands
Tower to the view, and the glades come out, and the glorious heaven
Stenches itself to its widest, and sparkle the stars multitudinous,
Gladdening the heart of the toil-wearied shepherd-even as countless
Twixt the black ships and the river of Xanthus glittered the watchfires
Built by the horse-taming Trojans by Ilium.""",ancientgreece

I've been doing some research into the battle of Thermopylae and the present-day location.  I've been searching Google Earth. I've been unable to find any present-day pictures of the famous double mountain pillars known as the  ""hot gates"".  From what I understand, the shoreline they fought on has been filled in flush with the cliff that the battle took place on. But that still doesn't explain why the mountains are no longer visible today. Did they even exist in the first place? Did they collapse? Was it filled in? Or is it just not visible?",ancientgreece

As part of thsat, I figured basing them in Athens would be good, so I'm trying to find a decent map of the city or at least a good idea of the layout from before the Persian invasions. Ideally in the ancient mytholigical era (or close to) during which Theseus would have have in Athens.

I'm finding plenty of old maps of Athens labelled as ""Ancient"", but some have notes and references to figures I thought were later in history (post-Xerxes) so any help from people who know better than I would be extremely useful. My knowledge of the mythology is decent enough for this game, but not so much the history.

Any help you can give would be appreciated. Thanks.",ancientgreece

1556739156,Homer's Iliad describes proto-Celtic clan wars,"By iteratively comparing similar passages in the Iliad and creating lists of common oral characteristics, I have been able to distinguish five different oral traditions that precede the texts of the legendary Homer. The second of these five, which I called the European Beta-tradition, is probably the most fascinating tradition among them, because it must be linked to a series of enigmatic historical issues: the raids of the Sea Peoples, the movements of the Urnfield Peoples, the fall of the Mycenaean and the Hittite empires, the onset of the Greek Dark Ages and the invasions of the Dorians in Greece. I hypothesize that the merger of the Urnfield Peoples with the Tumulus Peoples in an overpopulated Central Europe has created a warlike ideology or religion that used clever tactics to spread across Europe and, indeed, the Mediterranean region. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is how the European Beta-tradition must have arrived in Greece after the fall of the Mycenaean Empire. The battle scenes in the Iliad go back on wars between proto-Celtic clans in Central Europe, rather than stemming from Mycenaean Greece. This is why the Greeks built a wall from wood and earth surrounded by a ditch in the Iliad. These are the defense structures that we find across Europe, but not in mountainous Greece, which has stone castles without ditches. The ditch plays a central role in one of the typical scenes of the European Beta-tradition, namely gathering up the army for the fight. Also the strong similarities with the funeral habits of the Urnfield and Tumulus peoples and the accounts of Caesar and Diodorus of Sicily about the Celts and the Gauls point in the direction of Central Europe. 

&amp;#x200B;

1552271763,What If Ancient Greece Had Taken Over The World? (Fantasy Meets History),"**Warning: Apologies for the length, this is a complex topic. I don't expect everyone to read it. Feedback's welcome:**

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working since 9th grade (currently out of college) on an alternate history adventure story mixed with elements of Mythological lore and would appreciate a little help. I'm consulting multiple historians to make it as close to plausible as possible, balancing the alternate history at the forefront with the fantasy elements initially staying in the background.

&amp;#x200B;

The setting &amp; premise basically come down to one question, which I'd love to hear thoughts, ideas, suggestions, and criticism on from any knowledgeable students of history &amp; Greek Mythology out there. Please feel free to educate me about the likelihood of this concept, how it could have happened, and how I'd be essentially rewriting centuries of history.

&amp;#x200B;

It all starts with the trillion-dollar question: ""What if the Greek Empire not only survived but became the dominant culture in the world, essentially replacing North America's power/influence?"" What would a modern Ancient Greece look like? How would the people have likely evolved compared to other cultures? Which cultures would be likely to still exist?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm envisioning a world where several other peoples are still around such as some variants of Europeans and Asians, albeit with weaker/smaller/poorer societies compared to the dominant Greeks who are either ruled by them, are currently at war with them, or distance themselves from them. So, which cultures have the most probability to survive?

&amp;#x200B;

How would the Greeks' architecture have evolved? How would their technology have advanced and how similar of a direction would it have gone to our own (plumbing, agriculture, electricity, science, fire-arms, combustion-engine, etc)? How would their economy &amp; laws evolve? Ex- Would they become a Direct Democracy, Democratic Republic, dictatorship?

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify, I'm NOT suggesting taking this all the way to modern times or even the 1900's and speculating on how they may have shaped cars, cell phones, or computers. The furthest I'd go is probably the 1800's, maybe an equivalent to Victorian London in chronology &amp; what level their technology would be (Ex- Horse-drawn carriages are still common)?

&amp;#x200B;

How would their fashion, armor, and battle tactics have likely advanced? What about their police, army, navy? How would their politics &amp; philosophy have evolved compared to common philosophical principles we've adopted? What would their educational system be like? What would their relationship or lack-there-of be with the Greek Gods after so long?

&amp;#x200B;

1548434523,Are Aphrodite and Venus interchangeable in post-classical art?,"
I am writing a thesis about Aphrodite with a strong focus on paintings 
from the renaissance and modernity and I am having the problem that many
paintings (especially during the renaissance) are tributed to ""Venus""
not ""Aphrodite"". 

Now I have gone through some wikis and texts and from what I've gathered
these 2 names (from 2 different godesses) have become interchangable as time passed by.  

Is this correct? To give you an example: When visiting the Wikipedia article about Aphrodite (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite#Post-classical_culture)
almost all the pictures are namend after ""Venus"" not ""Aphrodite"".

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for your help!

This occurred to me in the context of Shakespeare - nearly half of his plays would have been lost without the extraordinary act of his friends to compile the First Folio after his death (and even more authoritative versions would have been lost).  The reasons for this are simple: without copyright protections, allowing your script to be published meant your competition could stage the same play next door the next night, and paper was expensive.  These would seem to be present in ancient Greece as well.  Yet we have 18-19 plays surviving from Euripides, who lived 2000 years before Shakespeare.  ",ancientgreece

&amp;nbsp;

Hello everyone. 

I am a university student in Vienna currently taking a class in „Visual Sociology„ and I am planning on writing my bachelor thesis during this lecture. I have always been interested in ancient Greece (though I also freely admit that I know very little about it) and writing a thesis about it seemed like a fitting idea.

Now, since I am still at the beginning of my thesis, I still have to figure out what exactly my topic should be. Since the class I am taking is about “Visual Sociology” I am obviously more interested in the visual aspects while historical, social or cultural aspects will take a bit of a backseat (but aren’t irrelevant!).

As the title suggests one topic I would be very interested in is the physical appearance of women in ancient Greece. This however is where I start running into problems. As I have mentioned I know very little about ancient Greece and don’t really know where to start. My main concern is that I want to make sure that I will find enough literature (and pictures) for my topic which is why I am posting here. 

&amp;nbsp;

Basically I am looking for any advice, sources (literature, pictures, ect) that would help me narrow down my project.

For example I was thinking of focusing on the body image of women in ancient Greece (i.e. the “ideal female body” during that time) or maybe I want to focus more on clothing, hairstyles and jewelry. I was even thinking of choosing one specific goddess and then focus on just her physical appearance.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, as you can see, I am still brainstorming and would really appreciate any advice or help you guys could give me. 

Thank you very much!

1539607830,How important was individual skill in formation fighting? Why train an individual soldier to his weapon as a solo fighter?,"Before I created my account on reddit, I saw two posts much earlier this year when I was lurking.

https://old.reddit.com/r/MilitaryHistory/comments/7vkyb0/how_important_is_individual_marksmanship_is_in/

https://old.reddit.com/r/ArmsandArmor/comments/7sxy9c/does_the_skill_of_individuals_in_martial_arts_and/

As both discussions state,indeed you always see the notion of ""teamwork trumps all"" in beginners book on history and history channel documents as well as internet discussions. I am wondering if individual skills matter in formations too? For example would how well a Roman raw recruit could stab his sword an important factor in formation? Like the poster in the two links state many statements such as ""the side whose phalanx holds together longest will wins"" makes it sound as though its pointless to learn how to aim at a target when throwing javelins at a mass of enemies. However even formation-heavy cultures like the Romans still emphasized training an individual to be both in his best physical shape and to individually stab at an enemy in single combat or aim at wooden target dummies to practise hitting darts on with individual marksmanship.

Is formation simply an automatic force multiplier like many TV shows or 5th grade history books imply? Since its always pointed out that the individual doesn't matter but the team does in pop history media such as games? Why even bother teaching a new Roman recruit in bootcamp the weak points of the human body or make an English yeoman practise his own bow skills by shooting targets as an individual if formations is the most important thing? I mean if you're going to shoot volleys I don't see why its important a javelineer  be taught how to throw a spears at the farthest distance possible. If you're going to be protected by a phalanx, why teach Athenian militia how to use his spear to parry and defend against attacks?

Can anyone explain why Mongol light cavalry would be taught how to hold a spear properly for a single jousting style duel even though his role is to be a hit-run archer? Or why Romans had young boys just recruited into camp practise one-on-one dueling if the Roman formations are what win battles? Why bother with these specific training if the side that holds the Phalanx longest is the winner?",ancientgreece

1539549797,"When you're in a shieldwall, do you feel impact of men rushing in (especially if they tackled you during the process)? As well as force of blows with weapons? How were shieldwalls able to hold on despite kinetic impact and physics?","Related with this post I made.

https://old.reddit.com/r/wma/comments/9o4cui/when_you_block_an_attack_with_a_shield_will_you/

So I'm curious after the results of my experiment, do men in shieldwall formations feel the exact same stuff I did when enemies rush in (especially in a disorganized charge like the Celts typically did)? Especially as their body tackles the shield wall and they swing their weapons in a melee?

If so, how could shield hold on in a very organized interconnected wall despite the kinectic energy and physics forces that would come after the enemy rams into the shields of individual soldiers and they swing their heavy weapons at each person in the wall? I mean I had enough difficulty against civilian grade weapons trying to block and parry in my experiment so I can't understand how an individual Roman soldier could take on the full body of a raging berseker without falling down and creating a gap in the shieldwall or how a shieldwall can stay interconnected despite a barrage of heavy swings of ax and hammer nonstop? 

I know war shields used by knights, Romans, Hoplites, Vikings, etcwere much heavier, stronger, and larger than the Cold Steel Buckler I bought so thats obviously a factor. But I cannot understand how shieldwalls can hold for hours despite nonstop blows (especially the first one which Roman accounts often describe as a barbarian running in and hurling himself at a shield)!

Can anyone explain how the shieldwall works to remain connected  despite impactful attacks?",ancientgreece
1539543168,"When you block an attack with a shield, will you always feel the impact transfer to your body (such as ringing and kinetic force that affects how the shield is held)? How do skilled fighters avoid getting off balanced and dropping a shield by a hard powerful blow?","My Cold Steel Buckler arrived on Friday. Before I went to HEMA class yesterday, I did an experiment at home on Friday.

I got my friend to hit me with feel force at the area where I was holding my shield with a variety of weapons. First I got him to hit me with my $35 scimitar. I was able to block all blows but I not only felt a ringing sounds and vibration effect on my hand each time I blocked a blow but I felt literally  gravity pushing my shield away. Just as interestingly I felt my whole body feel the impact of the kinetic energy each time I blocked a swing. As in even if I was not moved I felt the rest of my arm feel like I just got punched hard while wearing protective gear and my body could feel like I was just pushed back a bit. I even almost stumbled a few times I got hit.

Than I got my friend to hit me with a  4 feet long 5 lbs clubell. When I was being hit with the scimitar even if I temporary lost one of my footing, I could at least quickly go back to reposition my legs in proper standing and not every blow caused enough energy to make my body move, not even pushed back, even if it felt like someone was pushing me.. However with the bat I practically  lost balance of my shield enough a lot of times I fell down and furthermore even if I was able to not get knocked down, I was literally pushed several feet away enough times to note it. If I wasn't pushed away, my grip on the shield was affected enough that my shield would be knocked out of the way and even unintentionally dropping it a few times. The ringing along made my grip so uncomfortable I felt like dropping it at every blows, even weak ones, and by the time I was done with the bat my hand felt so numb and had a shaky feel to it I had to take a break. Like my nerves were affected directly.

Now when I got my friend to experiment with a 15 lb macebell, not only was the macebell able to get through every blow to break my shield away (even with him doing it controlled to avoid accidents and injuries), but I literally fell down on the ground like I slipped or am exhausted from running in only 3 strikes (and in each and every one of them). It was so terrifying to feel the power like I'm being hit by a car I stopped the experiment after feeling the macebell's impact shortly.

So I am wondering. I already know movies are a bunch of BS so how they show someone hold their shields and not get pushed back or show physical discomfort is flatout wrong I assumed even before I started the experiment. I was definitely expecting to feel some impact. However watching so many HEMA videos and Chinese martial arts online and seeing experts take direct hits from very heavy hammers and such without stumbling or feeling discomfort as they block it in a braced for impact manner made me wonder......... How the heck can they do that?! Even the scimitar already provided difficulty despite being  as light as 1.25 pounds enough I felt theimpact affect my legs enough to almost stumble or move its feet position a bit!

I mean I even tried experimenting with parrying the blows as its in the process of moving and while I felt much less impact, I still felt discomfort and numbness with vibrations in my hand! And thats just with the scimitar and a direct parry just a few moments after the sword was thrown (specifically when the sword still hasn't left from behind the shoulder during the swing)!

Can anyone explain if what I'm feeling is natural? If so how do HEMA fighters and East Asian weapon artists able to not fall to the ground or something when a heavy two handed mace is thrown?  This is my first time using a shield and I only practise HEMA two times a month so I don't know much. In fact this Friday I will attempt this experiment again at the HEMA club. However I'm frustrated and want to learn details! Can somebody clue me in?",ancientgreece

[MYTH Episode 26L]
(http://www.mythsyourteacherhated.com/episode-26l-reap-the-whirlwind)  

This week on Myths Your Teacher Hated, we're finally going to see what all the fuss has been about. You'll discover that rivers can be petulant, that Achilles is pretty good with a one-liner, and that you should never bring a bow to a spear fight. Then, in Gods and Monsters, it's a three for one sale on witches. This is the twelfth episode in the epic saga of the Trojan War from Greek mythology.

This is the Myths Your Teacher Hated podcast, where I tell the stories of cultures around the world in all of their original, bloody, uncensored glory.  Modern tellings of these stories have become dry and dusty, but I’ll be trying to breathe new life into them.

1530289218,Is this the only reference to Ancient Greece in the Bowie back-catalogue?,"David Bowie’s 1974 album Diamond Dogs was inspired by the dystopian fiction of George Orwell’s 1984 (as well as Big Brother, discussed here, there is another track on the album called 1984). As the album draws to a close, the penultimate track of the original release has Bowie’s persona begging for ‘steel’, more unreality and less personal freedom. It seems as though Bowie is suffering from Stockholm Syndrome brought on by too many William Gibson novels. It is in the chorus where we are confronted by the anachronistic cry of “someone to claim us, someone to follow, someone to shame us, some brave Apollo...”. In a vision of the future it seems odd to see a Classical god being called upon. However there is some sense in Apollo’s inclusion. Perhaps most obviously, a dystopian future would be a morally corrupt one. A simple way to help a listener imagine this society is to start calling on Pagan gods which automatically creates echoes of un-Christian (and therefore dystopian) behaviour. But the use of Apollo makes this specific deity’s inclusion in the lyrics more interesting. Firstly, Apollo had his own oracle at Delphi where there were two famous inscriptions: “know thyself” and “nothing in excess”. Is Bowie suggesting that such advice is what the future needs? They are certainly sage pieces of advice when dealing with issues today, especially in regards to technology. Perhaps Bowie is also thinking that Apollo could provide the cryptic clues needed for a better life; many who journeyed to Delphi thought he would reveal the guidance that they needed to make life-changing decisions. Secondly, and perhaps most interestingly in the context of Bowie’s chorus plea, is Apollo’s link to the Lydian king Croesus. Croesus tried to invade Persia and was captured by King Cyrus. He was about to be burnt to death until he managed to pique Cyrus’ interest in Solon’s advice. Cyrus decides to free Croesus, inspired by Solon’s wisdom, but it is too late - his pyre is already lit. Croesus then calls out to Apollo, begging him to save him - and miraculously he does! Is Bowie suggesting that we are standing on a fire created by our own hubris and now we need the power of Apollo to save us?

1530255467,Did Sappho influence Othello?,"One of the most important pieces of symbolism in Othello is Desdemona’s handkerchief. It is found throughout the play and leads to the downfall of the Moor. This piece of fabric is the focus of some (frankly) quite ridiculous conversations between Iago, Desdemona and Othello to demonstrate the ever-growing jealousy within Othello and the foolishness of his behaviour. When Othello stands on the stage and bellows at the top of his lungs “The handkerchief” three times, it is almost impossible not to ridicule the incongruity of his emotions with this ugly word. Regardless of its inappropriateness as a motive for murder, the handkerchief’s power is undeniable. This should not be a surprise as we learn that an Egyptian “charmer” gave it to Othello’s mother. It is Desdemona’s “first remembrance from the Moor” and is also a symbol of her fidelity to Othello; the handkerchief’s whiteness proves her purity and the strawberry design, “Conserved of maidens' hearts"" (3.4.74-75) is representative of her chastity. Therefore, Othello views the handkerchief with such importance, it is no wonder he starts to unravel when it has been lost and therefore the tissue is not quite as trivial as we think. The weight that this square of cloth carries proves that small items can carry emotional weight which can lead to sentimentality and eventually to irrationality.

Despite Shakespeare’s poetic power, the handkerchief still feels like an odd choice for a protagonist-toppling love token. Each emotionally charged conversation about the handkerchief sounds incongruous, especially when the word ‘handkerchief’ is actually enunciated; it just feels so un-Shakespearean. Why did he not use an item of jewellery or a letter or something other than the spiky-in-the-mouth handkerchief? Perhaps (and this is a big perhaps, with absolutely no evidence to back it up) the answer could lie in a translation of 4 words by the poet Sappho, which recently provoked me to ponder whether there may be a connection between Desdemona’s handkerchief and the Greek muse. To explain, there is a tiny fragment of Sappho that has been translated as, “A handkerchief, dripping with…”. It is impossible to read these words and not hear the sensual charge of this (dripping) handkerchief. What is it dripping with though? It is a question that has led to some interesting ideas, but almost all of them involve the body in some way. Did Shakespeare have access to this Sappho fragment? If he did, it may explain why he felt such confidence in hinging his tragedy around such a seemingly insignificant object. Sappho has breathlessly managed to make the napkin sound both romantic and seedy simultaneously – a feat that Shakespeare also achieves in his play. I would love to hear the thoughts of any scholars on this. Is there any chance that Shakespeare could have been influenced by Sappho's 'dripping handkerchief'? Desdemona's, after all, was itself dripped upon from maidens’ hearts. Ben Jonson famously wrote that Shakespeare knew “little Latin and less Greek”. Wouldn’t it be great if this remnant of Sappho was the “less Greek” he knew?

1641657397,Octavian response to caesars death,"When news of caesar death reached octavian, he was taking classes at apollonia, macedonia. One of its subjects were military doctrine with the 5 caesars legions drilling for a parthia campaign. Some of its officers, counsel him to stay with them for protection, but he refused, crossing to the region of brundisium in search for political gain. Learning caesars will content, that he was adopted by him and therefore, his primary heir (with 2/3 of his estate). He accepted caesars name, probably throwing away his own cuz it was more modest. Brundisium were a base of operations of eastern campaigns, octavian received a warm reception from caesars veterans there, probably given him courage to “steal” a lot of senatorial money intended for caesars parthian campaign cuz he intended to climb roman political ladder faster. He started marching to rome, using the money to employ caesars veterans and parthia intended soldiers in his army. Reaching rome, he found mark antony rivaling with him on caesars faction hegemony. Octavian got optimates support, as they saw him as a lesser evil than antony, and easier to manipulate. Therefore, antony lost this battle, especially when two of his legion passed over to octavian, “fleeing” to cisalpine gaul

The senate made octavian a senator and gave him veto and commanding power alongside the consuls, sending them with an army to resolve antony as a problem. On c. gaul, antony was besieging brutus brother. Octavian and one of the consuls were nearby, waiting for the other consul to arrive with reinforcements. Antony tried to fight before his forces was outnumbered, but the first consul denied it. Antony laid an ambush between the two armies. The second consul fell on it, but it was reinforced by the first one. In a narrow road, surrounded by marches, a bloody battle ensued. The consul was forced to retreat, but the first consul arrived and majorly defeated antony. Although octavian role was minimal, he was acclaimed imperator by his soldiers. Six days later, another battle took place, now on antonys camp. One of the consuls died inside it, octavian being in the thick of battle, got the eagle from an injured bearer and retrieved the consuls body. Antony lost again and decided to retreat to his reinforcements. The senate demanded that octavian handed over his command to brutus, as the two consuls were dead, but he refused. Brutus troops passed over to octavian, making him to flee

Octavian sent centurions as ambassadors to rome to demand the consulship. With its refuse, he marched on rome to no military opposition, being, therefore, elected consul alongside another caesar nephew. Antony allied himself with lepidus, a leading person of the caesarions. Later on, octavian joined them and they formed the famous 2nd triumvirate

I was impressed with the patience octavian demonstrated when antony denied his wealth, but him marching on rome was nuts. I understand he probably saw that the senate didnt truly respected him, but i dont think it was the best decision. I find the origins of the 2nd triumvirate strange. I see octavian on the higher ground then, why to ally with antony? Perhaps, he wasnt so higher. And indeed, the number brutus faction levied was insane",ancientrome

I'm sure he didn't anticipate people reading his personal letters for two milennia, but here we are.

So anyway, was this sort of cynicism/sarcasm about Rome typical for him? Obviously much of the city was pretty ramshackle at the time, but from what little I've read he seemed to take a lot of pride in the Republic and the city.",ancientrome

This is a very interesting Rome. It is no model for admiration but it does show us the principate, large and wealthy, slowly starting to sink.

We don't really have any frightening villains like Shapur or Hannibal, no Alaric or Attila, no Zenobia or Mithridates. 

In this period we have the spiraling growth of Mithras followers, the rise of Sol Invictus, the auctioning off to Julianus, the devaluation of the silver in the denarius, the fall of the Parthians, etc...

1641273923,Gibbons on the vanity of Pescennius Niger,"As soon as the intelligence of the atrocious murder of Pertinax had reached Antioch, the wishes of Asia invited Niger to assume the Imperial purple and revenge his death. The legions of the eastern frontier embraced his cause; the opulent but unarmed provinces, from the frontiers of Æthiopia to the Hadriatic, cheerfully submitted to his power; and the kings beyond the Tigris and the Euphrates congratulated his election, and offered him their homage and services. The mind of Niger was not capable of receiving this sudden tide of fortune: he flattered himself that his accession would be undisturbed by competition and unstained by civil blood; and whilst he enjoyed the vain pomp of triumph, he neglected to secure the means of victory. Instead of entering into an effectual negotiation with the powerful armies of the West, whose resolution might decide, or at least must balance, the mighty contest; instead of advancing without delay towards Rome and Italy, where his presence was impatiently expected, Niger trifled away in the luxury of Antioch those irretrievable moments which were diligently improved by the decisive activity of Severus.",ancientrome

1641035835,Soon to record episode on Hannibal at Trebia - any questions or aspects you want covered?,"Hi all,

As I am wont to mention it, I have a podcast (Ancient History Hound) and have covered a number of topic from ancient Rome (from the Baths through to a mini series on the Kings). I did an episode a few years ago on Hannibal's build up in Spain and how he developed there.

In 2022 I'm going to do a mini series on his battles of Trebia, Trasimene and Cannae. Depending on the interest I may also do more on his movements in southern Italy and perhaps Zama.

Anyway, I'm soon to record the episode I've written on Trebia. So far it looks at the build up (including a short overview of how Hasdrubal ended up in Spain), the characters involved, the units, what happened on the day and shortly after.

I'm always conscious of missing the obvious. So if anyone here has a question or aspect they'd like covered in relation to Trebia I'm all ears. I'll either do a question section at the end or ensure it's answered within the episode.

thanks!

1640754387,Germanic Barbarian Names,"So when reading late classical/early medieval Roman history I notice some Germanic names crop up that are still extant today. 

Two examples are 
* Roderick
* Frederick 

There are obviously names that have died out like Theoderic, Alaric, Athalaric, Theodohad etc. All the 'Suntha' suffix female names of the Goths seem to be long gone too, which is a shame because they're much prettier than the male names. 

I was wondering if the names Derrick and even Patrick have their origins in these Germanic names? I don't recall coming across a Derrick in this period (it would amused me enough I'd remember).

Second question, while lots of Punic/Jewish Biblical names have survived into the modern period, I suspect these are entirely revived rather than to be a continuum from ancient times. 

Is this the case with these Germanic names or has a name like Frederick really been in use for 1500 years?",ancientrome

1640734218,Sharing my research on the ethnicity of Marcus Aurelius,"Marcus Aurelius and his family came from the province of Hispania. Because I make depitctions of Roman emperors I really try my hardest to research what these men looked liked whether they be light or dark. 

I really want to say that I want to keep race out of this as much as possible and focus purely on genealogy and phenotypes. My motive for carrying out this research is to answer the question or at the very least come up with an educated guess based on some evidence on what ethnicity Marcus Aurelius was and whether he had Carthaginian or Celtic ancestry from where his family came from in the province of Hispania. His genealogy points to his family being from that region.

I believe Spain was very diverse at the time filled with people and families who never went back to Carthage after the Punic Wars and the descendants of the Iberians, Celtiberians, Tartessians, Lusitanians, and Vascones. All of which were Celtic and some of which would have had extremely light features. Marcus Aurelius and Commodus could have been a mix of several different ethnicities and of course had Italic ancestry.

I did some research and found these two reconstructed colorized busts of Marcus Aurelius, one of him as an [adult](https://external-preview.redd.it/1bJAOmSxeyLqHGbcTRuGlv0ybtKobblNakcPU8RlS6o.png?auto=webp&amp;s=8b5ea3cdea0d74ece16b21d5bc75da1dc896d043) and a [child](https://preview.redd.it/bv0kx6kw5o251.png?auto=webp&amp;s=cca80cf7dd31060dc5005ef219155101bf1e4926) which are based on the original pigment used. He appears to have brown curly hair and brown eyes. So he moderately dark features. That doesn't really say much as brown hair and brown eyes are extremely prevalent in the majority of humans regardless of ethnicity .

I proposed the idea that he might have had Carthagian or Tunisian ancestry but found it not likely and if he did it was probably very little. In comparison to the people of North Africa, Celtic people were very diverse in their appearance some having tribes having a propensity for white blonde hair and icy blue eyes, others sometimes having red hair and green/blue eyes and some even had extremely white skin with freckles which hugely contrasted their pitch black hair and a sort of golden brown eye color. I know this for a fact because my friends mother is Irish and she has pitch black hair, golden brown eyes, and extremely pale skin with freckles all over her face and body. 

I should also mention that curly hair is very common among some Celtic people. People with red hair are more likely to have wavy or curly hair. Celtic people are more likely to have red hair. You sometimes still see this in Ireland where some men and women have [red afros](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9745daca8d8fc18c375915bdb0cb89fe-lq) since Ireland has been more isolated from Greco/Roman, Frankish, and Anglo Saxon invaders in comparison to the former Celtic Kingdoms that existed throughout Europe. This means the Irish people still hold a very significant amount of genes from their Celtic ancestors since there was less ethnic diversity forced upon them by invasion, conquest and trade. Ireland has always maintained a very isolated attitude towards the rest of Europe and it's been that way even up until the 20th century which in some ways is responsible for all sorts of problems like terrorism throughout the United Kingdom in combination with religious differences and thousands of years of unresolved conflict. The Irish were historically less likely to let in outsiders therefore unlike the original Celtic inhabitants of Britannia there ethnicity remained pure and less diverse as the Celtic Britians were eradicated by interbreeding by conquering Romans and later Anglo Saxon, Norse people and Frankish tribes. 

So perhaps Marcus Aurelius and Commodus inherited their curly hair from a red headed Celtic ancestor and the brownish colored hair and eyes came from an a whole mix of Italic and Greek ancestors. Or it's possible they inherited their brown hair and eyes from a man or woman of Celtic descent? 

All I can say is there sure were a lot of diverse people in the ancient world. 

Usually when I look into the later emperors after the Flavian dynasty. I assume that emperors like Marcus Aurelius were not just one ethnicity or at least purely Italic, but instead I look at the modern world where in huge countries like American and Russia there are many different ethnicities living together and interbreeding. I see the Ancient Roman Empire which stretched from borders of Scottland to the edges of Parthia as no different. And even before the Roman Empire the Greeks had been colonizing and exploring west and northern Europe. As such the Celtic people living in the provinces of Transalpine Gaul, Hispania and Britannia almost certainly married into the aristocracy of  Patrician/Plebian men and their daughters who immigrated to those areas to become farmers as was the custom at the time, serve in the military as infantry police or participate in the many bureaucratic and governmental institutions that connected the provinces to the city of Rome to keep the Empire connected.

The stigma against Patrician-Plebian marriage for example had been declining since the 1st century BC and had started when Pompey the Great had won many victories and was the first Plebian to be awarded a military triumph. So it was becoming more acceptable to the point where in the 6th century a peasant became emperor and married a whore and he's now known as Justinian the Great.

The only reason I'm focusing on skin tone, hair color and eyes is because it's required for me to realistically portray these historical figures in my depictions. I want to get as close as possible to reality. I know that's impossible but I want to attempt to try. It's not a problem with facial features since you can clearly see and study them from their many busts and statues. For example Marcus Aurelius has a less prominent Aquiline nose than his son Commodus which might have been influenced by his mother.

Another interesting fact I found is that Marcus Aurelius and Commodus both have droopy eyes and curly hair which would imply both of those features are genetic. They obviously look very similar being father and son.

I found this research which suggests that droopy eyes can sometimes be a genetic trait of Northern Europeans and that leads me back to the Celtic connection.

&gt;The study, which was published in JAMA Dermatology, included two different groups in order to evaluate the extent to which droopy eyes are of a genetic cause. Of the first group of 5,578 unrelated participants with North European ancestry, 17.8 percent had moderate to severe sagging eyelids When researchers looked at the 2,186 twin participants, they found that within the pairs, 61 percent had inherited their sagging eyelids  
In addition to genetics, the study also found that age, being a male, having lighter skin color, and a higher body mass index (BMI) were all risk factors for sagging under-eye skin. A person with a higher BMI, typically has more fat accumulated than does a normal-weight person, which means their under-eye fat pads have a greater chance of being larger and protruding from the skin more.

Paul McCartney, Commodus and Marcus Aurelius [all have these droopy eyes.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/885043206243377193/925521093882708018/pmama.png) And the Celtic connection comes back again because Paul McCartney's family comes from Ireland.

&gt;It is unknown which part of Ireland Paul McCartney’s paternal side is from, but it is known that they first emigrated from Ireland to Galloway, Scotland, and then on to Liverpool.

Based on this research I find it likely that Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus had moderate to strong Celtic heritage from the locals living in Hispania. He definitely had Italic ancestry as well. Before some people accuse me of being a white supremist or whatever. This does not mean that his skin was particularly very white. Some Celtic people can in fact be darker in appearance and it might have been more common in certain tribes 2000 years ago. Some genealogists suggest that prehistoric Irish people had very dark skin, black hair and blue eyes.

He then took refuge with the Romans, but later when he was detected in sending letters and messages from the Roman camp to Tarentum and to Hannibal, he foresaw what would be the result and this time sought safety with Philip, at whose court he acquired such credit and power that he was almost the chief instrument of the ruin of that mighty kingdom.""

1640625895,Question about Caesar,"So I have read somewhere that historians seem to think that Caesar had a strange head shape (almost lopsided) due to the shape of his head on a certain bust. Is this true? And if it is, I don't think I agree with historians. 

I cut hair fairly regularly and have cut and seen a lot of different balding people and it got me thinking... So, everyone has more hair on one side of their head due to a preference of sleeping either on their left side or right side. This is because the fabric of your pillow rubs against your head and will pull hairs out. So if you sleep on your left side most of the time, the hair on the left side of your head will be thinner than on the right. This is what I think the abnormal head shape is from.

Could that be true? It's well documented that Caesar was balding, and balding on the top of the head would make the differences in hair density between the two sides of the head appear more exaggerated. So maybe his head wasn't weirdly shaped...maybe he just really liked sleeping on his right side of his body.",ancientrome

I am writing this post six days before the Kalends of January, which we know is the month of Janus. 

Now this way of ascribing dates was used for practically all of Rome's history. 

The Kalends being the first day of the month, the Nones being the ninth, and the ides being the division in the middle, usually the fifteenth. 

If Caesar had died three days later, folks wouldn't say ""Caesar died on the eighteenth of March"", they would say ""Caesar died three days after the ides of March"" 

It's a very interesting way of looking at dates because the seven day week didn't exist. Your birthday was always in relation to either the Kalends, the Nones, or the Ides. 

This changes in the fourth century, but we hardly hear about how this was done. The admiration for seven days come from the book of Genesis where it is said God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh. 

What was once _Dies Solis_ (Day of the Sun) became _Dies Dominica_ (Day of the Lord) and we see this in many languages such as Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and French. While German, English, and many others retained Dies Solis and hence why we have Sunday. This was done much later by Theodosius in 383. It is the official seal of Christendom in the Roman empire 

But this renaming isn't so much what we're concerned about in this post so much as the implementation of the seven day week and the elimination of the Kalends, Nones and Ides system. 

This must have been very confusing for folks. Is there any ancient material that talks about this transition? I've been reading many things from the Constantine and Valentinian eras but havent found something discussing this.",ancientrome

1640439382,How close was Claudius Gothicus to the Roman Senatorial elite?,"We can see how things change when Gallienus dies and the throne is passed to Claudius surnamed Gothicus. 

Valerian and his son, Gallienus grew up in Severan Italy. They were metropolitan Latin men who although not the most elite of that class, was in any case more similar to them than Claudius and Aurelian. 

We remember how the Roman world came to a panic in 69 AD and Vespasian assumed power. A man who would be unthinkable while Nero was alive. The prime men were those related to the Julio-Claudian stock. 

But we see this very interesting shift with Claudius taking the imperial power and fighting the Goths. Almost like old Marius taking the consulship by the horns and fighting the Cimbri. 

What were the Roman senators and Praetorian guard doing at this time? What made them just go with the flow with these Illyrian emperors? Surely the memory of Thrax was not that distant. 

I would think that after Gallienus died, they would at least try to put one of their own men up. But this fierce soldier was able to win their admiration I guess and seeing how fractured the empire was, I guess maybe they noticed beggars can't be choosers? 

I personally like to divide the Crisis of the third century into four periods:
Instability (235-253)
Collapse (253-268)
Recovery (268-276)
Stability (276-284) 

We see the imperial position really being pushed to the edge with Gallienus and Valerian.  

Was it just inevitable that the tough fierce men of Moesia and Pannonia were bound to be emperors?",ancientrome

So, I am currently in the process of writing the second book for my series based in the Roman Empire, and as I was working, I thought it would be great to add some maps to giving the reader a better picture of the world within the story. However, I am well aware that simply taking maps from the internet is a really good way to get sued for copyright infringement, so I was wondering if there was any place to find pictures that could be used that were either free or inexpensive to purchase. In particular, these were the maps I was hoping to find:

\-Roman Italy with as many labelled cities as possible.

\-Britannia or southern Britannia

\-Gaul, even better if it labels the tribes

Where the shepherds  on that glorious night had greeted the infant Saviour, singing in harmony with the host of angels in heavenly joy, a  mixed crowd of harlots and eunuchs lamented for Venus’  lover! How sad this is! What human devotion will be able to atone for such impiety? Where the sacred Child, the baby Saviour, had uttered His cries, that ill-famed rite  shrieked with the wanton grief of those counterfeiting the  laments of Venus. Where the Virgin had borne her child, adulterers were worshipped.  

This wickedness of an earlier age continued to the  time of Constantine, shortly before our day. He deserved  to be prince of the princes of Christ as much through the  faith of his mother Helena as through his own. The outcome proved that she was inspired by God’s plan when she  set eyes on Jerusalem. As co-regent with the title Augusta,  she asked her son to give her a free hand in clearing all the  sites there on which our Lord’s feet had trod, and which  were stamped with remembrances of God’s works for us. She sought to cleanse them of all the infection of profane  wickednesses by pulling down temples and statues, and to  restore them to their rightful allegiance so that the Church  might at last be famed in the land of its beginnings.

1639854148,"Discourse between the philosophical, pagan, and christian traditions in the Roman world","**Augustine** says in his *Civitate Dei* the following 

""  They say that they are called *monsters,* because they demonstrate or signify something; *portents,* because they portend something; and so forth. But let their diviners see how they are either deceived, or even when they do predict true things, it is because they are inspired by spirits, who are intent upon entangling the minds of men (worthy, indeed, of such a fate) in the meshes of a hurtful curiosity, or how they light now and then upon some truth, because they make so many predictions."" (Book 21.8)

**Cicero** talks very much about the fallacies of divinations and even the Bacchnalian rites in his *Divintione*, and also says "" But for my part, believing as I do that the gods do care for man, and that they advise and often forewarn him, I approve of divination which is not trivial and is free from falsehood and trickery."" (On Divinaton)

Augustine condemns these traditions as 'demons', on the other hand Cicero views them with his nonchalant indifference. We likewise see **Seneca** taking this view when he condemns the lifestyle of the multitude and that the wise man practices the reading of philosophy and consults the great men of the past in practically all of his letters to Lucilius and his larger works.

**Celsus** likewise urges this path in life but **Origen** refutes him by saying 

"" For who is there that, on betaking himself to the study of philosophy, and throwing himself into the ranks of some sect, either by chance, or because he is provided with a teacher of that school, adopts such a course for any other reason, except that he believes his particular sect to be superior to any other? For, not waiting to hear the arguments of all the other philosophers, and of all the different sects, and the reasons for condemning one system and for supporting another, he in this way elects to become a Stoic, e.g., or a Platonist, or a Peripatetic, or an Epicurean, or a follower of some other school"" (Contra Celsum)

But I think an excellent description is found in Origen where he says 

"" But since the course alluded to is impossible, partly on account of the necessities of life, partly on account of the weakness of men, as only a very few individuals devote themselves earnestly to study, what better method could be devised with a view of assisting the multitude, than that which was delivered by Jesus to the heathen? And let us inquire, with respect to the great multitude of believers, who have washed away the mire of wickedness in which they formerly wallowed, whether it were better for them to believe without a reason, and to have become reformed and improved in their habits "" (Contra Celsum)

**Zosimus** gives us an accout of what **Theodosius** said to the pagans in the fourth of book of *Historia Nova* regarding the expences of the ceremonies.

"" Theodosius, therefore, told them, that the treasury was too much exhausted by the expence of sacred rites and sacrifices, and that he should, therefore, abolish them, since he neither thought them commendable, nor could the exigencies of the army spare so much money. The Senate in reply observed, that the sacrifices were not duly performed, unless the charges were defrayed from the public funds. Yet thus the laws for the performance of sacred rites and sacrifices were repealed and abolished, besides other institutions and ceremonies, which had been received from their ancestors ""

This is quite an impressive blow to the ancient traditions and although the Stoics, Peripatetics, Epicureans, and many others likewise criticized the flashy festivals and ceremonies, they never really were able to curtail their expenditure that much and force their philosophies on the people. In other words, they did not proselytize. 

Various civilizations and city-states criticized each other for being too decadent, too sensuous, and even too supersititious as we see in **Caesar** Gallic Wars where he criticizes the Gauls and Druids for their uncivilized superstitions in book 6 

Moreover, we also see **Juvenal** rolling his eyes at Roman women for following Chaldean astrologers saying: 

""But even greater faith’s placed in the Chaldeans: whatever the astrologer claims, women will believe to have issued out of Ammon’s oasis, the Oracle at Delphi having fallen silent, and the human race now blind as regards the future. Yet the first of these astrologers is the one most often exiled. They’ll trust his skill, if his right hand’s rattled the chains, His left too, if he’s languished in some distant military gaol. No astrologer lacking a criminal record possesses any talent..."" (Satire 6)

It's very interesting to see how Christianity was able to leverage its way between the vast number of pagan tradtions and cults while the philosophical schools really just contained themselves in their own little ivory tower.",ancientrome

1639808743,"How can anybody be an admirer of Roman history and like HBO's ""Rome""?","I find it incredible that certain persons in this subreddit still wax poetically about HBO's ""Rome"".  If there were ever a show that mangled Roman history to an incredible level, that was it.  The show was supposed to provide an ""authentic"" experience, at the very least, but it did not even manage this. 

Most of the plot was ridiculous.  Considering that it dealt with a very well-known period of history, it managed to make it unrecognizable.  Julius Caesar is presented like an oversexed fool pursuing a mid-50's lady (Servilia) to the degree that he forgets to pursue the civil war and has to be shamed to finally go after Pompey.  He is also scheming to sell his veterans short.  Nothing of which is even remotely true.  Octavian, a known prude sleeps with his sister; why not try a little incest?  Cleopatra is a perennially doped-up idiot who does not know what is coming or going.  doped-up.  Brutus kills Caesar because his mother, Servilia, put him up for this.  Listen, this stuff could have been the foundation of a great comedy!!

Then one comes to the key characters, Pullo and Vorenus.  Here the plot just goes to typical tropes of two army buddies, as if the Roman army was nothing more than the US military fighting with just swords.  The total experience of soldiers and centurions in the Roman army was absolutely different from any models that one is familiar with.  Nothing can be as inauthentic of Rome as these characters.  For much of the rest of the show, one has the ""Gangs of New York"" translated into a toga-clad script.

Although the show recreated the Roman forum adequately (there were a few discrepancies), much of the rest was not even close to what one would have experienced living in that period.  The most laughable part was the depiction of Alexandria.  Subreddit members here can easily find digital recreations of Alexandria of that period.  What was in the show resembled more Pi Rameses, the capital of Egypt 1200 years earlier.  So much for authenticity.  Everything in Egypt was laughable. 

Some redditors here say that the show creators did not want to film a ""documentary"".  This is laughable.  One can create a very good show while staying close to recorded history.  A great example of this is BBC's  ""I Claudius"".  All the facts are accurate; the motivations are, of course, the creations of the author, Robert Graves.  I am more than sure that Claudius did not designate Nero as his heir because he wanted Britannicus to restore the Republic.  He definitely did, anyway, and he never recorded his motivations regarding this for posterity.  Just parenthetically, after the Messalina coup that he barely survived, he needed a true Julian in the succession to restore confidence in the credentials of the imperial family....but this is another matter.

In conclusion, those who watch Rome get a Julius Caesar who is a parody of the real man, have a totally warped idea of what happened and why, and have not watched anything nearly authentic.  it was really only a toga show of extremely low quality.  HBO was correct in cancelling it.",ancientrome

1639642530,Story of Spartacus ( continued) Part 3,"In the Spartacus army, there was a split from it, 30 thousand people separated under the command of Crixus. This detachment of rebels (historians to this day argue about their composition – were they Germans or Italians) in the battle of Mount Gargano in Northern Apulia was destroyed by the Romans under the command of the consul Lucius Gellius. If the legionnaires took the rebels prisoner, it was only in order to execute them.

Such a loss greatly weakened the army of Spartacus. However, the leader of the rebellious Roman slaves turned out to be a talented commander. Taking advantage of the disunity of the actions of the advancing armies of the consuls G. Lentula and L. Gellius, he defeated them one by one. A well-organized and trained army of rebel slaves demonstrated their superiority over the Roman legions in every battle.

After two such heavy defeats, the Roman Senate had to draw up troops from distant provinces to Italy hastily. After these two great victories, Spartacus’ army marched along Italy’s Adriatic coast. But even as the Carthaginian commander Hannibal, the leader of the rebellious slaves, did not go to Rome, which was in awe of the real threat of the appearance of a huge army of rebellious slaves and the Italian poor before its walls.

In northern Italy, in the province of Cisalpine Gaul, at the Battle of Mutin (south of the Padus Po) in 72, Spartacus utterly defeated the troops of the proconsul Cassius. From Mutina, the Romans fled to the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is known that Spartacus did not pursue Cassius.

Now the rebellious slaves, who dreamed of finding freedom, were within easy reach of the Alps. Nobody stopped them from crossing the Alps and ending up in Gaul. However, for unknown reasons, the army of the rebels turned back from Mutina and, once again bypassing Rome, went to the South of the Apennine Peninsula, keeping close to the coast of the Adriactic sea

The Roman Senate sent a new army against the rebellious slaves, this time 40,000, under the command of the experienced commander Marcus Licinius Crassus, who came from the equestrian class and was distinguished by cruelty in establishing proper order in the army. He receives under his command six Roman legions and auxiliary troops. Crassus’s legions consisted of experienced, war-hardened soldiers.

In the fall of 72, an army of rebellious slaves concentrated on the Bruttian Peninsula of Italy (present-day province of Calabria). They intended to cross the Strait of Messina to the island of Sicily on the ships of Asia Minor Cilician pirates. Most likely, Spartacus decided to raise slaves to revolt in this, one of the richest provinces of Ancient Rome, which was considered one of his granaries. In addition, the history of this Italian region knew many performances of slaves with weapons in their hands, and Spartacus most likely heard about this.

However, the Cilician pirates, fearing to become blood enemies of the powerful Rome, deceived Spartacus, and their naval fleets did not come to the shores of Bruttia, to the port of Regia. There were no ships in the same port city since the rich Roman townspeople, when the rebels approached, left Rhegium on them. Attempts to cross the Strait of Messina on homemade rafts were unsuccessful.

Meanwhile, the army of Marcus Licinius Crassus went into the rear of the rebellious slaves. The legionaries erected a line of typical Roman fortifications at the narrowest point of the Bruttian Peninsula, which cut off Spartacus’s army from the rest of Italy. A moat was dug from sea to sea (about 55 kilometers long, 4.5 meters wide and deep) and poured into a high bank.",ancientrome

1639603654,Story of Spartacus (continued)Part 2,"By the beginning of 73 BC. Spartacus’ detachment quickly grew to 10 thousand people. The ranks of the rebellious gladiators were daily replenished by fugitive slaves, gladiators, the ruined peasants of the Campania province, and defectors from the Roman legions. Spartacus sent out small detachments to the surrounding estates, freeing slaves everywhere and taking away weapons and food from the Romans. Soon the whole Campania, with the exception of the cities protected by strong fortress walls, was in the hands of the rebellious slaves.

Soon Spartacus wins a series of convincing victories over the Roman troops, who were trying to suppress the slave uprising in the bud and destroy its participants. The summit of Vesuvius and the approaches to the extinct volcano became the scene of bloody battles. The Roman historian Sallust wrote about Spartacus of those days that he and his fellow gladiators were ready “to die from iron rather than from hunger.”

In the fall of 72, the army of the praetor Publius Varinius was completely defeated, and he himself was almost captured, which plunged the authorities of Rome into considerable confusion. And before that, the Spartacists utterly defeated the Roman legion under the command of the praetor Clodius, who presumptuously set up his fortified camp right on the only path that led to the summit of Vesuvius.

Then the gladiators weaved a long staircase from the vine and descended along it from the mountain cliff at night. The Roman legion, suddenly attacked from the rear, was defeated.

Spartacus showed excellent organizational skills, turning the army of rebellious slaves into a well-organized army, modeled on the Roman legions. In addition to the infantry, the Spartacus army had cavalry, scouts, messengers, a small baggage train, which did not burden the troops during their marching life.

Weapons and armor were either captured from the Roman troops or made in the camp of the rebels. The training of troops was established, and also according to Roman models. The teachers of slaves and the Italian poor were former gladiators and fugitive legionnaires, who perfectly wielded various weapons and military formation of the Roman legions.

The army of rebellious slaves was distinguished by high morale and discipline. Initially, commanders of all ranks were chosen from among the most experienced and reliable gladiators and then appointed by Spartacus himself. Management of the Spartacus army was built on a democratic basis and consisted of a council of military leaders and a meeting of soldiers. A firm routine was established for camp and marching life.

Almost nothing is known about the other leaders of the powerful slave uprising in ancient Rome. History has preserved only the names of Kirks(Crixus) and Enomai(Oenamus), two, apparently, Germans, who were elected by the rebellious gladiators as assistants to Spartacus, becoming the commanders of his army.

The first victories of the rebellious slaves met with a wide response. From Campania, the uprising spread to the southern regions of Italy – Apulia, Lucania, Bruttia. By the beginning of 72, Spartacus’ army had grown to 60 thousand people, and during the campaign to the South, it reached, according to various sources, the number of 90-120 thousand people.

The Roman Senate was extremely concerned about the extent of the slave revolt. Two armies were sent against Spartacus, led by experienced and famous victories by the generals – the consuls Gnaeus Lentulus and Lucius Gellius. They hoped to succeed by taking advantage of the disagreements that had begun among the rebels.

A significant part of the slaves wanted to escape from Italy through the Alps in order to find freedom and return to their homeland. Among them was Spartacus himself. However, the Italian poor who joined the slaves did not want this.",ancientrome

1639591352,Story of Spartacus,"Presumably, Spartacus was born in Thrace (modern Bulgaria). Antique authors report conflicting information about his life. According to some sources, he was a prisoner of war, fell into slavery, and was assigned to the gladiatorial school in Capua (City in Italy). According to another version, the Thracian served as a mercenary in the Roman army, then fled and, being captured, was given to the gladiators.

Spartacus was distinguished by physical strength, dexterity, and courage, skillfully wielded weapons. For his abilities, he gained freedom and became a fencing teacher at a gladiatorial school. Spartacus enjoyed great prestige among the gladiators of the Capua school of Lentula Batiak and then among the rebellious slaves of Ancient Rome.

About the physical strength of Spartacus and his mental talents, Plutarch, a Greek philosopher, said that “he was more like an educated Hellene than a barbarian.” “He himself is great in his own strengths of body and soul” – this is how another ancient Roman writer Sallust speaks of the leader of the rebellious slaves.

The greatest slave revolt in the ancient world had the most fertile ground. Wars flooded Italy with slaves of various ethnic groups Gauls, Germans, Thracians, Hellenized inhabitants of Asia and Syria… The bulk of the slaves were employed in agriculture and were in extremely difficult conditions.

Due to their brutal exploitation, the life of the Roman slaves was extremely short-lived. However, this did not particularly disturb the slave owners, since the victorious campaigns of the Roman army ensured an uninterrupted supply of cheap slaves to the slave markets.

Of the city slaves, gladiators were in a special position. Not a single celebration could do without gladiatorial performances in ancient Rome of that era. Well-trained and trained gladiators were released into the arena to kill each other for the joy of thousands of Roman citizens.

There were special schools where physically strong slaves were taught the art of gladiators. One of the most famous schools of gladiators was located in the province of Campania, in the city of Capua.

The uprising of slaves in ancient Rome began with the fact that a group of gladiator slaves (about 70 people) fled from the Capua school after discovering a conspiracy and taking refuge at the summit of Mount Vesuvius.

In total, there were more participants in the conspiracy under the leadership of Spartacus – 200 people, but the guards of the gladiatorial school and the city of Capua defeated the conspirators at the very beginning of their performance. The fugitives have entrenched themselves on the inaccessible mountain peak, turning it into a military camp. Only one narrow path led to it from the valley.",ancientrome

1639581650,Why I was hurt reading The Annals by Tacitus,"I spend two years reading Titus Livy and Polybius. Then I moved on chronologically and got to read Sallust Jugurthine War, and Plutarch's biographies. I read Caesar's books on the Gallic Wars and the Civil War. 

It was so wonderful and panoramic. 

Reading about these heroic Romans opening themselves up to the world and charting in new territories. Culminating finally in young Augustus and the annexation of Ptolemaic Egypt. 

Then we move into such a new world that a certain luster is lost. I even felt sad when I reading on the death of old Lepidus. A man who died in such a different Rome than the one he came into. 

It hurts to read Tacitus and feel ourselves in this new chamber with Tiberius and apathetic senators. Maecenas and Agrippa are dead, the rostra lost its splendor, and while there is this threat from the Parthians and Germanic tribes, we find ourselves really in a whole new Rome. So different from that of Cato and Scipio. Even from the one of Marius and Sulla. 

I found myself so inspired by Germanicus, I felt him to be this unique character in this post-Augustan Rome and loved his adventures.

1639367887,Would Knowing Romanian Make it Much Easier to Learn Other Romance Languages? As well as Slavic Languages? How about Latin?,"I live near Romanians and one the female member has been teaching Romanians for free at a building because my town has enough Romanians that there is the official Church of their country has a local building here (apparently a national one where everything is done in Romanian and all books are in that language, etc).

Their eldest Aunt is a very warm person and has told me to feel free to go to the local boarding building to learn lessons despite not being Romanian or a member of their national Church and she even agreed to do a few private lessons to me because (well I guess its partly because a few time I just helped a few members of the community out of the blue in different situations, though the girl is a pretty warm person herself in an Audrey Hepburn charming sortaway).

So I am gonna go ahead take the offer because I have nothing else to do in my free time and I admit I never took another language before. In fact I was gonna order some Dutch CDs to learn the language my fav celeb Audrey Hepburn but I decided to shelf that plan after receiving the next door neighbor's offer.

So TIL Romanian is a Romance Language. So does that mean knowing it would make French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and a whole other bunch of obscure language I just learned today from across Europe much easier to learn?

In addition reading on Wiki the language has a strong Slavic influence esp in word count. Enough I seen a few Redditors calling if a hybrid of Russian and Italian. So does that mean learning the language would put me a step up in learning Russian and Polish and other Eastern European languages and Balkan tongues such as Serbian?

Last but not lest a few posts online not just here in reddit but various blogs and forums, etc says Romanian is the one Romance Language today that is closest to Latin after Sardinian and some other old languages across Italy before the Unification.

1639057569,How the pagan gods and traditions were taken less seriously,"It's very interesting to hear Prudentius call the traditional practices of the ancient Romans ""Superstitio veterum avorum"" (superstition of old grandpas) 

When we browse through the pages of Roman history, we see Christianity rising little by little but what we often don't see is how less and less the old gods were taken less and less seriously. 

One of the main things people gloss over is the importance of Alexandria and Antioch. These two cities were not just touristy capitals but extremely important centers of learning. Alexandria prided itself on being the child of Alexander the Great and Antioch prided itself on being the child of Antiochus the Great. 

Athens, Corinth, and Thebes were cute. Nobody really cared about them that much. When we look at the works of gentlemen like Dio Chrysostom and Lactantius. The former of which says of prostitution 

*""if old customs and diseases that have become entrenched in the course of time fall to the care of our ruler, he shall by no means leave them without attention and correction, but, with an eye to what is practicable, he shall curb and correct them in some way or other.""* (Euboean Discourse) 

We see how the more learned men are beginning to question things that were so common in people's lives and which would eventually diffuse into Christian teachings. By the 2nd century, Seneca and Cicero were considered classics, and their more rational philosophy impacted these orators.

Lactantius in his *Institutiones Divinaes* chastises old men who are obsessed with incense and calls the worshippers of Venus as people who make ""dolls"" for her. 

""*men offer to these dolls, which are of large size, and adorned as though for the stage, both perfumes,* *incense**, and odors: they* *sacrifice* *to these \[dolls\] costly and fattened victims, which have a mouth, but one that is not suitable for eating; to these, they bring robes and costly garments, though they have no need of clothing; to these, they dedicate gold and silver, of which they who receive them are as destitute as they who have given them.*"" (Divine Institutions)

In many ways, these late Roman orators and Christian writers criticize the old pagan traditions as the French philosophes criticize holy water, iconography, the wine blood of Christ, geocentrism, and other church teachings. They looked at it and said ""These things are very silly and ridiculous"" 

Hence, why Prudentius calls it the superstition of old grandpas. It doesn't hold much weight in a cosmopolitan multi-continental empire where the dominant language is Greek and Latin. 

But in that old world of Carthaginians, Persians, naked Gauls, etc... it is very normal.  

Claudius Pulcher was villanized for throwing the sacred chickens in the sea during the 2nd century BC, but in the 2nd century AD, many people see it as a cute little story that's not meant to be taken seriously. The old Punic war becomes mythologized and it's quite interesting how by the imperial period, practically all of pre-Caesarian Rome is already referred to as *αρχαίος* (Greek for 'archaic') or in Latin, antiqua. 

Anthony and Cleopatra is mythologized, Hannibal, Mithridates, etc... people no longer take the old religious traditions seriously. They ask themselves

What's the point of digging up a pig's intestines? What's the point of lavishing perfume and purple clothes on a life-size doll of Venus and Minerva? Hence, these things, throughout the decades, become more and more unpopular, especially around the time of the Cyprian plague and third-century crisis, when showering gifts on statues during a time of immense poverty was seen as an insult.",ancientrome

Really been enjoying it.

One thing I don't understand however:  For many hundreds of years, over and over again the Roman Army, under the command of various generals or emperors went to war with various barbarian tribes.  They keep on saying that the Roman battle formations/tactics were not well suited for fighting in the forests. In the open field the Roman army was unstoppable but in the forests their disciplined lines weren't easily maintained and they were disadvantaged.  I can understand this, and for the first several encounters over a couple decades, perhaps, this makes sense. But how after many centuries of engagements could they not have developed new tactics to fight the barbarians more efficiently?  Or did they, and the documentary is kinda dropping the ball on this one?  Thank you!",ancientrome

As a race with the same long history, with black hair and yellow skin,  people can't help but guess whether Sumerian-speaking Chinese has  something to do with it. From the perspectives of race, language, and  religion, it is really possible. From the perspective of race, Sumerians  are yellow people with black hair.

Egypt and Seleucia were no longer scary in the first century BC. Yet I would figure they would at least take some part in the war against Mithridates. Why were they chilling? 

Bithynia and Pergamon are gone. Both have been bequeathed to Rome. But what about Galatia? What were they up to? 

Surely Egypt would try to at least play a role in the east by trying to fight Tigranes and sharing the spoils with Rome, but they didn't do this at all. It's quite surprising since they had such a keen hatred for the Seleucids. 

Speaking of Seleucia, this is the war that they finally die. In the third Mithridatic war, they get annexed by Armenia and then eventually by Rome. But certainly, they could have tried to pick themselves up during that first war with Sulla, right? Why were they so pathetic in this period?

When we look back at the beginning of the 2nd century BC, Seleucia and Egypt had Antiochus III and Ptolemy Epiphanes.

1638110302,Did Nero really kill his wife? Here's what you need to know,"We all know the infamous story of Nero killing his pregnant wife by a kick in the belly.  


&gt;He dearly loved Poppaea, whom he married twelve days after his divorce from Octavia, yet he caused her death too by kicking her when she was pregnant and ill, because she had scolded him for coming home late from the races.  
&gt;  
&gt;– Seutonius, *Nero 35.3*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Sabina also perished at this time through an act of Nero's; either accidentally or intentionally he had leaped upon her with his feet while she was pregnant.  
&gt;  
&gt;– Cassius Dio, *Epitome of Book LXII.27.4*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;After the close of the festival, Poppaea met her end through a chance outburst of anger on the part of her husband, who felled her with a kick during pregnancy.   
&gt;  
&gt;– Tacitus, *Annals XVI.6.1*

Tacitus further adds that some writers claimed Nero poisoned her, though he does not believe them.

&gt;That poison played its part I am unable to believe, though the assertion is made by some writers less from conviction than from hatred; for Nero was desirous of children, and love for his wife was a ruling passion.   
&gt;  
&gt;– Tacitus, *Annals XVI.6.1*

Many people do not know that apart from Nero, Persian King **Cambyses II** (Son of Cyrus the Great), **Periander** (Second Tyrant of the Cypselid dynasty that ruled over ancient Corinth) and **Herodes Atticus** (Athenian sophist and teacher of young **Marcus Aurelius**) have been attributed to have killed their pregnant wives by a kick in the belly during pregnancy. Cambyses and Periander killed their pregnant wife in the same manner as Nero, whereas Herodes was accused by his brother-in-law of having his freedman kick his pregnant wife in the belly but was later exonerated by Aurelius.  


&gt;But the Egyptian tale is that as the two sat at table the woman took a lettuce and plucked off the leaves, then asked her husband whether he \[Cambyses\] liked the look of it, with or without leaves; ""With the leaves,"" said he; whereupon she answered: ""Yet you have stripped Cyrus' house as bare as this lettuce."" Angered at this, they say, he leaped upon her, she being great with child; and she died of the hurt he gave her.  
&gt;  
&gt;– Herodotus, *Histories 3.32.4*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;By her \[Lysida\] he \[Periander\] had two sons, Cypselus and Lycophron, the younger a man of intelligence, the elder weak in mind. However, after some time, in a fit of anger, he killed his wife by throwing a footstool at her, or by a kick, when she was pregnant, having been egged on by the slanderous tales of concubines, whom he afterwards burnt alive.  
&gt;  
&gt;– Diogenes Laertius, *Lives of Eminent Philosophers Book I.7*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But among the eminently philosophic actions of Marcus we must include his behaviour in this trial. For he never frowned or changed his expression, as might have happened even to an umpire, but he turned to the Athenians and said: Make your defence, Athenians, even though Herodes does not give you leave. And as he listened to the speeches in defence he was greatly pained, though without showing it, by many things that he heard. But when the decree of the Athenian assembly was recited to him, in which they openly attacked Herodes for trying to corrupt the magistrates of Greece with the honeyed strains of his eloquence, and when they exclaimed: Alas, what bitter honey! and again, Happy they who perished in the plague! his feelings were so profoundly affected by what he heard that he burst into tears without concealment. But since the Athenian defence contained an indictment not of Herodes only but also of his freedmen, Marcus turned his anger against the freedmen, employing a punishment which was as mild as possible; for by this phrase he himself describes his judgement. Only in the case of Alcimedon he remitted the penalty, saying that the loss of his children was enough. Thus did Marcus conduct this affair in a manner worthy of a philosopher.  
&gt;  
&gt;– Philostratus, *Lives of the Sophists 2.1.8* \[Trial of Herodes**\]**

There is no doubt that Nero truly loved his second wife Poppaea Augusta Sabina. He wrote several poems dedicated to her of which only some are extant.

&gt;After a fight or chariot race,  
my head dissolving in your lap  
I lie and gaze up at your face.  
&gt;  
&gt;In crowds you subtly lean, hands twine…  
Some nights your lust is fierce and sudden.  
Rotten with wine, your thighs ride mine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Each glance, each kiss is contraband.  
“Fancy it's you again,” we laugh  
and every night's a one-night-stand.  
&gt;  
&gt;– *Epithalamium (trans. Geoffrey Lehmann)*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Wearing Augustus's sun-hat  
amongst our courtyard plants I sit  
and eat and drink with you, Poppaea.  
Together we grow old and fat.  
&gt;  
&gt;– *Love Lyric (trans. Geoffrey Lehmann)*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;At night I wear your dresses in our bed  
and howl. Each day  
your perfume in the room is weaker.  
I'll go to Greece, never come back.  
&gt;  
&gt;– *Elegy for Poppaea (trans. Geoffrey Lehmann)*

The second poem may have been written after Poppaea’s death. Nero supposedly burned a year's worth of Arabia's incense production at her funeral.

&gt;Her good fortune has been caused by the luxury of mankind even in the hour of death, when they burn over the departed the products which they had originally understood to have been created for the gods. Good authorities declare that Arabia does not produce so large a quantity of perfume in a year's output as was burned by the Emperor Nero in a day at the obsequies of his consort Poppaea.  
&gt;  
&gt;– Pliny the Elder, *Natural History 12.41.1*

As stated by Vasily Rudich in *Political dissidence under Nero*, we must keep in mind Suetonius's, Tacitus's, and Cassius Dio's severe biases against Nero and the impossibility of their knowing private events, and hence recognize that Poppaea may have died due to fatal complications of miscarriage or childbirth which was common during that time. 

This was my attempt to do a critical analysis of the Uxoricide accusation. ""Nero kicked his pregnant wife by kicking"" is usually one of the first things to be commented when speaking about Nero. Did Nero really commit Uxoricide or was he the victim of character assassination by later historians based on a historical pattern of powerful men playing football with their pregnant wives? I happen to believe the latter.",ancientrome

1637973594,Writers/ poets of late antiquity?,"This may just be my perception but it seems the best Roman writers/poets existed from around 200 BC to maybe 50 A.D.

Cato, Seneca, Cicero, Virgil, Julius Caesar  etc etc all seem to be from this period.

The last notable/ remarkable Roman writer/ philosopher was Marcus Aurelius who died in 180 A.D. 

After that barring some major Christian theologians there wasn’t much in the way of “ classic” Roman literature or Philosophy.

More to the point , I think somewhere around 200-250 Rome stops being “ fun” to read about or learn about.

From that point on it just seems to be a lot of civil war and plotting with little in the way of “ Roman Rome” if that makes sense.

My question is; what determines the name given to the Legion? Is it determined by where the legion was recruited or where it was stationed, or is there some other basis for it?

This was made all the more confusing by the fact that multiple versions of the same name existed (e.g. ""Legio I Italica"" through to ""Legio V Italica""), which I took to mean that Legio V Italica was the fifth Legion raised in Italy - but I was unsure so I thought I'd ask, especially considering that the Italic Legions I've seen during research appear to have been stationed somewhat far from Italy (e.g. I Italica in Bulgaria) and some legions don't appear to have names related to places at all (e.g. ""II Augusta"" or ""VI Victrix"").

-	It’s standard issue and use coincided with the height of Rome’s military dominance (late Republic thru 2nd century AD)

-	Superior penetrative power capable of piercing through enemy shields sufficiently to kill the wielder.

-	Whether by design or merely a convenient feature of its construction material, the long iron shank of the pilum was nonetheless known to bend on impact, dramatically decreasing the utility of the weapon if recovered by an enemy.

-	Pila with more hardened shanks also existed, which could additionally function as a melee weapon/spear if necessary.

Arguments for Plumbata

-	Legionaries could carry as many as 5-6 Plumbata (as opposed to only 1 or 2 pilum), subjecting their enemies to a far greater barrage of projectiles before engaging in melee. 

-	Due to their small size and light weight, plumbata could by hurled a much greater distance and therefore possessed a longer effective range.

-	Plumbata appears to have prevailed as the preferred weapon of Romes legions because the pilum eventually fell into general disuse.",ancientrome

I found the lecture to be fascinating and thought it was a cool connection between Rome (Pompeii) and the United States. I know many easily discern the influence of Roman architecture within Washington D.C. (such as the Jefferson Memorial and the Pantheon) however, I found it quite interesting to see a direct connection between Pompeiian murals and the murals inside of the U.S. Capital building.

1637318436,"What do you think about Julius Caesar being a meditation deity (God) in Tibet for the last 1,200 years?","Since about 740AD there has been an increasingly embellished legend in Tibet/Mongolia, about a man named Fromo Kesar (Roman Caeser) or Great King Gesar. This Kesar (Julius Caeser) is also a diety/god (meant for use in visualization meditation). I wonder what Caeser would think if he knew that some people see him as a literal God (for more then a thousand years)?

The story of Kesar is probably based on the life of Julius Caeser given similarities to events in his life. For example: Kesar has a wise uncle that is the a leader in Ling (Ling means island/peninsula in Tibetan) who trains/reforms the military \[*Gaius Marius, Caesers uncle*\]. Kesars uncle has a greedy &amp; cowardly rival \[*Sulla*\] that gets Kesar stripped of his titles and banishes him \[*Sulla stripping Caeser of his priestly titles and forced him to go into hiding*\]. When Kesar is banished he ends up with (or captured by) wild men that he’s rude to/taunts, later kills them \[*Caeser &amp; the pirates?*\]. Later Kesar wins 30 battles, including a massive siege, against the “barbarian borderlands to the North"" \[*Guals*\]. Then he meets the queen of a neighboring country and falls in love \[*Cleopatra*\]. His wife is kidnapped (carried on a rug) by another king, and Kesar burns his palace \[*library of Alexandria*\]. Later demons in the disguise of his closest friends/monk advisers stab him to death (taken out in later versions). “Kesar” becomes a title/name for the Kings of Ling (Caeser was an Imperial title). The story came to Tibet from Turkish Islamic invaders, who got the story from Byzantium.",ancientrome

They ask you to craft a plan for the immediate hours and days after they kill Caesar to restore the Republican system of government while avoiding civil war and eliminating any chance of another dictator replacing Caesar.

Your orders will be followed explicitly, the conspirators and their agents will carry out your plan to the letter in the minutes, hours and days after the assassination.

The actual killing of Caesar is already planned and will take place exactly as history records. Your task is to determine what orders should be carried out in the immediate aftermath of Caesar's death.

Limitations: You have no way of knowing that Octavian is the primary benefactor of Caesar's will, so you cannot give orders to eliminate him in the immediate aftermath. Anything else is fair game, however, you must consider the political and public relations consequences of your actions.

1637063004,Important cultural developments to consider in the 2nd century AD,"Theres this bias that many people have, a presumption really, that past centuries were really nothing more than just the same period in terms of culture and traditions. We look at the 1980s as being radically different from the 1930s and this has some great truth to it. But for the Romans, this was likewise the case. 

&amp;#x200B;

The 2nd century, or the age of Antonines, definitely had a continuous development of culture, ideas, and traditions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lets briefly just look at the 180s and compare them to the earlier part of the century. 

&amp;#x200B;

The former was the reign of Commodus, the latter the reign of Nerva/Trajan/Hadrian.

&amp;#x200B;

People in the 180s for one had more tolerance for Mithraists and followers of Serapis. You couldnt just kill a slave without a trial at court. There was also much more to see and travel to beyond Italy, Antioch was becoming more and more popular. The works left by Hadrian and Trajan greatly enriched the empire, the Ulpian library, now decades old, had provided a fountain of knowledge to the Roman people. Emperor Commodus threw lavish games and in the eyes of many people, this was Rome at its apex. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was more appreciation for science, Pliny had become a household name and there was also Galen and Cleomedes. The works of Celsus was gaining popularity, Christianity had become more mainstream and yet it was only one of the many religions in the whirlpool of different religions and philosophies. Art was saturated, more mosaics, more frescoes, and it was something that made its way more and more into the far flung regions of the empire. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the early 2nd century, in the old Nerva/Trajan period, people were really beginning to grow and prosper after those stable but static years of Domitian. This is that great age of Pliny, Suetonius, Tacitus, Plutarch, and architects like Apollodorus. Trajan's market comes in, the Pantheon gets rebuilt. The 110s and 120s are that period where you start seeing a real decline in farming as Egypt and Africa provides mass food imports. This is Rome really growing and becoming more cosmopolitan and sophisticated. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is why by the 180s, people already live in such a different empire than their forefathers. But they also have to deal with the plague, more factious groups, the debasement of the consulship, a wider diaspora of people, more urban violence, long bread lines, etc... 

&amp;#x200B;

By the end of 2nd century you had a generation of people who were too young to see or remember that post-Domitian boom; the great reigns of Nerva, Trajan and Hadrian. 

&amp;#x200B;

You only have to look at somebody like Lucius Verus, somebody who did not really remember the age of Hadrian and was not alive during Trajans time, to see what the generation that grew up in the great tranquil period of Antoninus was like. 

&amp;#x200B;

We often forget that the period of Marcus Aurelius and Verus was the most unstable out of the five good emperors and that Verus himself had many problems. 

&amp;#x200B;

So by the time somebody like Commodus comes in and we are in the late 2nd century, we have a generation of people that dont remember the great conquest of Dacia, Trajans Parthian campaign, or a Rome that was more agricultural, less diverse, less urban, in other words more \_flavian\_. 

&amp;#x200B;

By the late second century, the Flavians were history and a tale of old Rome. There was no more Chatti and Cherusci to fear. It would be just as ridiculous as if the people from the Gracchi time were to fear the Boii and the Senones. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anything, we should treat the second century with more careful analysis to see how the empire transitioned in this important period. It is Rome's great transition from the height of the empire to the growing problems of the late empire",ancientrome

1636741204,Is Cicero worth reading?,"I recently saw a new book in the philosophy section of my local book store. It was a copy of a book that was said to be written by Cicero. Not exactly a book per se, but a collection of personal letters and writings that he wrote throughout his life.

I'm interested in reading something by Cicero, but I'm also a little skeptical on how good of a writer he really was. 

I've always read that Cicero wasn't the best roman leader. I read that although he was a great orator, he was also an irresponsible governor, a laughable general and wasn't much of a scholar. I've always felt that the only reason Cicero is so we'll remembered is because he just so happened to be a powerful and wealthy politician during a particularly turbulent and important time in roman history.
However I don't really think he had any actual merit of his own. He was just born into wealth and power and happened to be an outside commentator to the works of actual important figures like Pompey or Augustus.

I found it a little ironic that a book by Cicero would be on the same shelf as Plato's republic or Marcus Aurelius' meditations. Has anyone actually read Cicero's philosophy, and if so, was it any good?",ancientrome

1636640776,Voltaire's comment on Odoacer and Genseric's invasion,"Voltaire has a very interesting comment in his Philosophical Dictionary which goes as follows 

""Do you really and truly believe that the Herulian Odo, surnamed Acer by the Romans, and known to us by the name of Odoacer, had only Herulians in his train, and that Genseric conducted Vandals alone into Africa? All the wretches without talent or profession, who have nothing to lose, do they not always  join the first captain of robbers who raises the standard of destruction?""

It's an interesting statement and it really made me consider how exactly the Ostrogoths and Vandals were really able to take down Italy and Africa. 

Surely, the ""wretches"" who had nothing to lose would fear the approaching Goths and Vandals. 

But at the same time we are reminded that these people were Christians and also ""Foederati"" so this is where the lines get a little blurry for me. 

The people of the empire didn't see these groups the same way they once saw the Cimbri descending down on them or perhaps the Huns who they saw as infinitely more savage. 

We know Odoacer by the name ""Flavius Odoacer"" but this is a very Latin name. Historian JB Bury also says the following 

""Orestes was killed at Placentia along with his brother Paulus outside Ravenna. The Germanic *foederati,* the Scirians, and the Heruli, as well as a large segment of the Italic Roman army, then proclaimed Odoacer ""Rex Italiae"" 

Now clearly, if Odoacer and his men had imperial ambitions, they would hail him as ""Augustus"" but this wasn't the case. Why not? Wouldn't it be more impressive to have that title rather than king of Italy? And what's with the Roman legions backing Odoacer in the first place?

OP: *“\[Romans\] Doesn’t even know what a boat is.”*

Commenter*: “The Romans had great navies. Look at the Punic wars. Look at Pompei ridding the Mediterranean of pirates.""*

I understand the comment and so written a reply on what OP meant by that statement. Many people are unaware of the fact that 3rd Century BC Rome was highly asymmetric in her's land-based and sea-based military capabilities. Here, I have expanded upon my initial reply to tell this very interesting story on how Rome solved her asymmetry problem.

Many people may not be aware of the fact that in the 3rd Century BC Rome didn't have any real naval presence and Carthage's navy dominated the Mediterranean. Before the First Punic War (264–241 BC) , the Roman Republic had not campaigned outside the Italian Peninsula. The First Punic War was in essence *UFC1 - Control of the Mediterranean.*

# TL;DR

In 265 BC, the disastrous misunderstandings at [*Messana*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Messana) initiates the First Punic War. In 264 BC, Rome's direct run at Carthage ends in disaster. In 260 BC, [Appius Claudius Pulcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Claudius_Pulcher_(consul_249_BC)) (Consul 249 BC) tries to invent a Roman navy from scratch. A string of victories follow after [Gaius Duilius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Duilius) (Consul 260 BC) invents the [*Corvus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvus_(boarding_device)) fleet in 261 BC, however storms kill tens of thousands. In 241 BC, [Gaius Lutatius Catulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Lutatius_Catulus) (Consul 242 BC), a Roman admiral, finally knows how to sail. Rome is victorious at the [Aegates Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Aegates). Carthage buys its way out of the war.

# Summary

The war in Sicily reached a stalemate, as the Carthaginians focused on defending their well-fortified towns and cities; these were mostly on the coast and so could be supplied and reinforced with the Romans unable to use their superior army to interdict. The focus of the war shifted to the sea, where the Romans had little experience; on the few occasions they had previously felt the need for a naval presence they had usually relied on small squadrons provided by their Latin or Greek allies.

Rather than accept Greek-Italian help building a fleet, Pulcher’s forces:

\- captured a few Carthaginian ships and had Roman carpenters study them, once pulled onto the beach

\- built replicas as volunteer Italians practiced rowing on benches (nearby on the beach)

\- sailed to catch the Carthaginians operating on Sicily’s north coast to achieve surprise

\- won the first morning’s assault but lost the campaign (and the ships began sinking).

The Romans built 120 warships and dispatched them to Sicily in 260 BC for their crews to carry out basic training. [Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnaeus_Cornelius_Scipio_Asina)'s (Senior Consul, 260 BC) expedition to the [Lipari Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Lipari_Islands) ends in disaster and was captured by the Carthaginians.

Consul Gaius Duilius took over command of fleet operations and began winning within a year because of the clever invention - *Corvus* 

\- which used the same Roman farm carpentry skills and intuition

\- which did not require fresh training

\- which used conventional Roman infantry

After the pain of the war against Pyrrhus (which had just ended) their pride seems to have insisted on ""do it yourself"" approaches.

*In Chapters 1.22-4-11 of his History, Polybius describes this device as a bridge 1.2 m (4 ft) wide and 10.9 m (36 ft) long, with a small parapet on both sides. The engine was probably used in the prow of the ship, where a pole and a system of pulleys allowed the bridge to be raised and lowered. There was a heavy spike shaped like a bird's beak on the underside of the device, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship's deck when the boarding bridge was lowered. This allowed a firm grip between the vessels and a route for the Roman legionaries (who serve as specialized naval infantry called marinus) to cross onto and capture the enemy ship. - Wikipedia*

Gaius Duilius actively encouraged the Carthaginian ships to attack his Corvus fleet. He sailed his leaking vessels right up to Carthaginian formations, harassing the deck archers but maneuvering clumsily until they moved to ram his ships. Using Corvus, he stormed his Roman land fighters onto the other ship, the ship he preferred, at which point the usual lesson learned from his tactics is that he turned a sea battle into a land battle which Romans could win. The Romans' application of boarding tactics worked by winning several battles, most notably those of [Mylae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mylae), [Sulci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sulci), [Tyndaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tyndaris) and [Ecnomus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ecnomus).  
In the [Battle of Mylae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mylae), Duilius captured several enemy vessels, including [Hannibal Gisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Gisco)’s flagship, and was thus the first Roman successful in a naval engagement.

But the win at the Battle of Ecnomus created a disaster. Sailors still unfamiliar with the Mediterranean winds took the invasion fleet southwestward toward Africa, running into winter gales from the northwest. The Corvus bridges caught the wind, the fleet rolled and sank killing perhaps 40,000. Followed by another 10-20,000 lost reserved that were committed to find the first lost fleet. Roman politics dissolved into demonstrations, protests, and religious panic. 

In 240 BC, Rome finally got an ""Admiral"" who learned to sail. He was *C. Lutatius Catulus.* Catulus replaced the corvus bridge with the harpax ballistae (bolt-throwers) mounted down the sides of the ships. Corvus is not mentioned in period sources after the Battle of Ecnomus.

But a decade of anxiety and clumsy sieges around the rim of Sicily had passed, and another storm took perhaps another 6-10,000 lives. Finally, at the Battle of the Aegates Islands (241 BC), not only did the harpax corvus work, but Catulus – spotting bad weather – stowed all his ships’ masts and maneuvered into position stealthily by oar. Carthage was defeated by seamanship and bought its way out of the war within months.

1635709274,Some thoughts on Hadrian.,"\-Hadrian had to pull out of the middle east because the empire was overextended beyond the reasonable limits placed by Augustus. ""mo land mo problems""

\-There were revolts in the rear (Kitos war)

\-Parthians were recovering strength and the campaign would only be more difficult going forward

\-Trajan did not plan for the empire past his death, good thing Plotina picked the capable Hadrian while Trajan lay dead. Hadrian and Plotina both believed in promoting Greek culture. 

\-Hadrian had to execute the few senators/generals he did to avoid civil war that would undo all Trajan and Nerva accomplished in settling the empire and senate

\-Trajan babied the senate and provided the generals with lots of glory and work. Hadrian threatened their livelihood/prestige/auctoritas with the withdrawal so they became angry

\-Post hence these executions he increased the senates rights and privileges trying his best to appease

\-Hadrian creates ""permanent"" borders along Augustan lines (plus Dacia and Brittania) and makes peace with Parthia while granting independent to Armenia

\-Hadrian shows himself as a humanist emperor. Promoting culture around the empire, cancelling public debt, banned worst forms of torture, provided slaves more rights, gave the soldiers and their families more rights (marriage while on duty, illegitimate children can inherit)

\-Hadrian appeared to truly care about the average person in the empire, not just himself, the senate, of the city of Rome itself. He travelled extensively and addressed all problems, big or small, that he reasonably could to the best of his ability

\-No expansionist wars, cancelling debt, and providing jobs via large infrastructure and building projects created wealth. It also provides us with many of the ruins we see today. Hadrian was the greatest builder in Rome's history

\-Hadrian was his own architect. Designing the Pantheon, and his mausoleum now known as Cast St Angelo. 

\-He believed in a cohesive and co-operating Mediterranean empire with Greco-Roman culture as the leading force for improving civilization for the lot of the population. He recognized the disparate population of the empire

\-Jewish revolt in 132 was a complete rejection of his ideal of empire. Jewish people would continue to be a thorn in the cohesiveness he was trying to build in the Mediterranean. He reacted very harshly to delete this perceived threat for the future (I am NOT advocating just explaining his possible thought process) 

\-His attempts at unity point to his belief in a share Mediterranean culture. His obsession especially with Greece is shown in his architecture and religious practice. Even so far as creating a mini-Greece in Tivoli and joining in the Eleusinian Mysteries 

\-He was IN LOVE with Antinous, he was a tourist, he was a art collector, a poet, and idealist, and a clear thinking military strategist.

\-Then he was a grief stricken lover, depressed and suicidal, defeatist and no longer as motivated. To me he is one of the most human emperors and much more relatable than a distant Augustus or a regal Nero",ancientrome

1635696335,Quintillian fuming about the culture and practices of his day,"Quintillian lived in the first century AD and flourished under the Flavian dynasty, his iconic work *Instituto Oratoria*, on the institution of oratory, is one of the greatest works of ancient Rome and he goes into a great deal on his advice for what is good oratory and how it should operate in society. He does give his strong opinions about the current culture and practices of his day, here are some of those passages below.

From *Instituto Oratoria* 

**On Education and Teachers**

""I strongly disapprove of the prevailing practice of allowing boys to stand up or leap from the seats in the expression of their applause. Young men, even when they are listening to others, should be temperate in manifesting their approval."" 

""But in the schools of today we see boys stooping forward ready to spring to their feet: at the close of each period they not merely rise, but rush forward with shouts of unseemly enthusiasm.""

""The actual practice of declamation has degenerated to such an extent owing to the fault of our teachers, that it has come to be one of the chief causes of the corruption of modern oratory; such is the extravagance and ignorance of our declaimers""

""But any of these faults are tolerable compared with the practice of chanting instead of speaking, which is the worst feature of our modern oratory, whether in the courts or in the schools and of which I can only say that I do not know whether it is more useless or more repugnant to good taste""

**On Music**

""I think I ought to be more emphatic than I have been in stating that the music which I desire to see taught is not our modern music, which has been emasculated by the lascivious melodies of our effeminate stage and has to no small extent destroyed such manly vigor as we still possessed. No, I refer to the music of old which was employed to sing the praises of brave men and was sung by the brave themselves.""

**On Theater and Philosophy**

""The vocabulary of the tragedians is full of dignity, while in that of the comedians there is a certain elegance and Attic grace. They are, too, more careful about dramatic structure than the majority of moderns, who regard epigram as the sole merit of every kind of literary work. For purity at any rate and manliness, if I may say so, we must certainly go to these writers, since today even our style of speaking is infected with all the faults of modern decadence.""

""To say nothing of the language of the uneducated, we are all of us well aware that whole theatres and the entire crowd of spectators will often commit *barbarisms* in the cries which they utter as one man.""

""I am ready to admit that many of the old philosophers inculcated the most excellent principles and practiced what they preached. But in our own day, the name of philosopher has too often been the mask for the worst vices. For their attempt has not been to win the name of philosopher by virtue and the earnest search for wisdom; instead, they have sought to disguise the depravity of their characters by the assumption of a stern and austere mien accompanied by the wearing of a garb differing from that of their fellow men.""",ancientrome

The next incident was between Marc Antony and Octavian. Similarly, a mob was coming after Octavian and only Marc Antony’s intervention helped them. Once again it was before escalation into war during their rivalry. It seems puzzling to me that these individuals would save their rivals from a mob. Does anyone have insight into this behavior? The only conclusion I’ve considered is that patricians would view their rivalries as something “amongst patricians”",ancientrome

1635360524,Help with interesting quote from Suetonius,"I was reading Suetonius work and his historical account of the Caesars and one passage stuck out at me and it was this one: 

“Having thus secured the imperial power, he realised the wish of the Roman people, or (I may venture to say) of all mankind; for he had long been the object of expectation and desire to the greater part of the provincials and soldiers, who had known him when a child; and to the whole people of Rome, from their affection for the memory of his father, Germanicus, and compassion for the family almost extinct. Upon his moving from Misenum, therefore, although he was in mourning, and reverently attending the corpse of Tiberius, he had to walk amid altars, victims, and lighted torches, with prodigious crowds of people everywhere hailing him in transports of joy, and calling him, beside other auspicious names, their ‘star’, their ‘chick’, their ‘pretty puppet’, and ‘bantling’.” [Suetonius, Caligula 13]

From my study of Caligula I’ve heard him been referred to as the “Mad Emperor.” In my experience also he’s known for his cruelty, debauchery and overall madness. Why exactly is Suetonius speaking like this about him? What is the exact content, context and significance of this source? I think I need to understand that if I want an answer. Thanks!",ancientrome

1635246488,What I liked and didn't liked about DOMINA series,"Watched probably every movie/series regarding Rome and had recently discovered this new series that had dropped early this year.

&gt;Domina is a historical drama limited television series created and written by Simon Burke for Sky Atlantic (Italy) and Sky Atlantic (UK). Starring Kasia Smutniak as Livia Drusilla, it examines the power struggles of Ancient Rome from a female perspective.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Wikipedia

Essentially, *Domina* shows the life and rise of Livia Drusilla, the powerful wife of the first Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar.

After watching season 1, here's a list of some things I liked and didn't liked about the show.

**Liked**

1. The [intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LafqAEPbLvg) music is nice.
2. Refreshing to hear Marcus Antonius than Mark Antony.
3. Agrippa's role is given justice here than in BBC's Rome.
4. Fantastic performance by Liam Cunningham who plays Livius, Livia's father.
5. Strong performances by both actresses playing Livia Drusilla.
6. Beautiful choreography. Visually, the show is stunning.
7. Love the costumes. On googling, the costumes were designed by the Academy Award winning Gabriella Pescucci. No wonder they were good.
8. Augustus was known to have nervous breakdowns which is nicely shown in the show.
9. Augustus's dilemma when he was informed that Livia cannot bear him children has been shown in the show.   
Love Livia's quote - ""The one thing he \[Augustus\] wants more than a son is power. Maybe I can give him that.""
10. Teenager Tiberius is shown to be cunning which really might be the actual reality.

**Disliked**

1. Teenager Octavian's hair style like who in Rome had that kind of hair style.
2. Livia's affair with Sextus Pompeius during her refuge in Sicily. Might be purely fictional as I do not know any sources that says this.
3. Marcellus, Octavia's son, is shown to be purely homosexual who cannot even bed his wife. Again, pure fiction.
4. Teenager Tiberius's incestual feeling towards his mother. Yikes. Maybe to provide structure for his Capri's shenanigans in future seasons. Tiberius really cannot catch a break from Seutonius.

The show sacrifices historical accuracy to spice things up but I can ignore that. This show is miles better than other series like Netflix's *The Roman Empire*.",ancientrome

1635209074,How did that austere and glossy Byzantine aesthetic come about?,"Let's sit down for a minute and see how this came about. 

I mean that the best art in the Roman empire was from the Julio-Claudian up to early Severan period. I would even magnify it to the Augustan period up until Domitian because the depictions were not only more realistic but also there is more diversity of art. We see animals, hunting scenes, food, sex scenes, gods, etc.. but we also see well done things in later period but with more influence from the provinces. 

This glossy austere Byzantine aesthetic starts poking its head when? The Tetrarchy? I mean we still see some elegant mosaics but we also start seeing less beautiful sculptures; that kind of starts to go.  

But then later we get these goofy Picasso-looking artworks in the frescoes and coins. Which even makes the artworks from Magna Graecia in the pre-Punic period look like masterpieces. The frescoes start having more circles, more glossy backgrounds, less mobility, fewer plants and animals, less delicacy. Everything starts looking austere and watchful. Everybody looks daggers at you.

*""Here is a list of the main emperors rated in categories from best to worst in terms of policy, diplomatic, administrative and military skills, ability to keep peace, achievements and long-term impact.""*

**Description of Constantine I**  
Constantine (r. as Western Caesar 306-309, as co-Augustus 309-324, as sole emperor 324-337 CE): Constantine was defined above all by his ruthlessness. He killed his two brothers-in-law in order to become sole emperor, effectively destroying the tetrarchy system established by Diocletian. He later had his oldest son and heir, Crispus, executed for an unproven affair. Constantine was the first Christian emperor and although he didn't dare make Christianity the official religion of the empire yet, he did all he could to subsidise Christianity with the taxes from pagans and granted exceptional powers to Christian bishops. He is basically responsible for the collapse of traditional Roman cult and values. He also disbanded the Praetorian Guard, moved to capital to Byzantium, which in a megalomaniac fashion he renamed after himself Constantinople. Constantine created a Police State, a large and corrupt administration (a ""Byzantine"" administration as it later became known) and reinforced the hereditary class system introduced by Diocletian. He formalised the distinction between the frontier army and the better paid mobile army, a decision which the Greek historian Zosimus claims was responsible for the ultimate collapse of the Western Roman Empire.",ancientrome

I'm working on a Fantasy book that uses the Roman Empire as inspiration for a particular region of my world.

So, I'm trying to find the political breakdown of leaders, regions they controlled, and the approximate size of the area. A Dux controlled how much territory? What level were they in the hierarchy? What was the name of an area controlled by a Dux? A Duchy?

Google is vague on this or doesn't understand what I'm asking; either way, Reddit has helped me before in my research for other aspects, and I'm hoping it can again. Also, I'm trying to keep all titles and nouns in the original Latin; therefore, if you could also draw parallels to something like the English political breakdown through nobility, that would be great!

I think it’s actually a cool, important language to learn and think it’s been massively undersold by our society. It’s far more important then Klingon or Sudoku or just some fun but minimalistic hobby.

1. It’s a history, humanities grammar and language course rolled into one. Learning Latin permits you to know the history and thought process of Ancient Rome in addition to the grammar and origins of our own language.

2. Gateway to Romance languages. Not a bad launching pad to learn the Romance languages. About 80-90 percent of Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese have their origins in Latin.

1634991804,Khosrow advanced towards Hierapolis and Beroia.,"Background of the invasions of Khosrow I into the lands of Justinian in the year 540.

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ancientrome/comments/pzqio4/here_is_an_interesting_dialogue_of_gothic_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ancientrome/comments/qdcj44/may_540_khosrow_i_invades_the_east/)

&amp;#x200B;

With that I go back to my previous narrative,

The emperor Justinian, learning of the Persian invasion, immediately sent his nephew Germanos with three hundred followers in great disorder, promising him that a large army would soon follow. Upon reaching Antioch, Germanos went around the whole circuit of the wall; the greater part of it he found secure, for the part along the plain is washed by the Orontes river, blocking it off to attackers, while the part on higher ground rises upon steep hills and is quite inaccessible to the enemy. But when he reached the highest point, which the men of that place call Orokasias, he noticed that the wall at that point was very easy to assail. For there happens to be in that place a rock that spreads out to a considerable width and rises to a height only a little less than the fortifications.

He therefore commanded that they should either cut off the rock by making a deep ditch along the walls, in case anyone tried to mount from there upon them, or they should build upon it a great tower and connect its structure with the city wall.

&amp;#x200B;

The engineers protested that there would not be enough time to complete such a project. They argued that the rapidly marching spah(army) would arrive quickly at Antioch while these engineering works were still under construction. The Sassanians would then quickly realize the weakness imperilling Antioch and seek to take advantage of it. Germanos grudgingly accepted the logic of these arguments, apparently hopeful that a large force would soon be sent by Justinian from Constantinople

The Antiochenes deciding it was best to send money to Khosrow to negotiate with him to leave, sent Megas a Bishop of Beroia who was residing at Antioch at the time. Quoting Prokopios as follows,

&gt;Coming into the presence of Chosroes, he entreated him to take pity upon men who had committed no offense against him and who were unable to resist the Persian army. For it was least of all proper for a man who was king to trample upon and do violence to those who were retreating before him and were unwilling to resist him. Not one thing that he was then doing was kingly or noble because, without giving the emperor of the Romans any time in which to deliberate whether to make the peace secure in the way that seemed best to both sides, or to prepare for war in accordance with a mutual agreement, as was reasonable, he had recklessly advanced in arms against the Romans, even before their emperor knew what was going on.  
&gt;  
&gt;When Chosroes heard this, he was unable by reason of his ignorance to moderate his stance, but was confirmed in his intention even more than before. He therefore threatened to destroy all the Syrians and Kilikians and, instructing Megas to follow him, led his army to Hierapolis.

&amp;#x200B;

Khosrow set up camp outside the city and sent Paulos as an interpreter. This Paulos had been raised in Roman territory and had attended an elementary school in the city. Said to be Roman in origin. The city of Hierapolis agreed and gave Khosrow 2,000 Pounds of Silver. Megas who arrived from Antioch tried to force Khosrow into an agreement that he would ask for 10 Kentenaria of gold (1,000 pounds of Gold, equal to 1,0000,00 sesterces.) and in exchange Khosrow would leave Roman lands. Khosrow agreed. He took the ransom and advanced towards Beroia.

&amp;#x200B;

Khosrow upon reaching Beroia demanded twice the amount received from Hierapolis as he saw much structural weaknesses on the city walls. Prokopios does not specify what structural weakness is present. The Beroians agreed to give 2,000 Pounds of silver but were unable to give the rest. Khosrow pressed them further to give more. During the night, the Beroians retreated into the acropolis of the city. The next day, Khosrow sent men to receive the money, but upon realising the city gates were barred, he ordered his men to scale the walls with ladders and assault the city. They did so with little resistance. Khosrow then besieged the acropolis within the city, burning the rest of the city as punishment. The Beroians made the mistake of bringing their animals into the acropolis as there was only 1 spring which was drank dry by the animals.

Megas reached Antioch and failed to carry out his side of the agreement as Justinian had sent Ioannes, the son of Rouphinos, and Ioulianos, his private secretary, as envoys to Chosroes. The Romans call this office a secretis, for secrets they conventionally call secreta. These men had reached Antioch and were staying there. Ioulianos, one of the envoys, explicitly forbade everyone from giving money to the enemy or purchasing the cities of the emperor. He also denounced to Germanos the chief priest Ephraimios as being eager to deliver the city over to Khosrow. For this reason Megas returned unsuccessful. But Ephraimios, the bishop of Antioch, fearing the attack of the Persians, ran to cilicia.195

Megas failing in his task, arrive in all haste to Beroia and was shocked at what had befallen the city and reproached Khosrow for the act, quoted by Prokopios,

&gt;Megas then came in haste to Beroia and, in anguish at what had taken place, he accused Chosroes of having treated the Beroians in an unholy way, for while he had sent him to Antioch to arrange a treaty, he had plundered the property of the citizens, although they had committed no wrong at all, and had forced them to shut themselves up in that fortress; he had then set fire to the city and unjustly razed it to the ground.

Khosrow replied as follows,

&gt;My friend, you yourself are responsible for these things, by forcing us to delay here; for you have arrived not at the appointed time, but far too late. As for the strange conduct of your fellow citizens, my good man, why should we discuss it at length? After agreeing to give us a fixed amount of silver in exchange for their own safety, they even now do not think it necessary to fulfill the agreement but, placing such complete confidence in the strength of their position, they are disregarding us absolutely, so we are now compelled to undertake the siege of a fortress, as you see. For my part, I hope that with the help of the gods I will have vengeance upon them shortly, and execute upon the guilty the punishment for the Persians whom I have lost wrongfully before this wall.

Megas replied as follows,

&gt;If one were to consider that you are making these charges as a king against pitiable and lowly men, he would be compelled to agree with you without a word of protest; for the nature of kings is such that prevailing in arguments is a function of their power in general.  
&gt;  
&gt;But if one is permitted to shake off all else and focus on the truth of the matter, you would have nothing, O king, with which to reproach us justly. Please hear me out gently. As for me, since the time I was sent to declare to the Antiochenes the message that you wanted announced to them, seven days have passed—truly, what could be done faster than that?— and now, coming into your presence, I find these things done by you against my fatherland.  
&gt;  
&gt;But these men, having already lost all that is most valuable, have only one struggle to engage in thereafter, that for their lives; they are now, I think, in a position beyond having to pay the rest of the money to you. For by no device can a man pay a thing that he does not have. The names of things have been long distinguished by men well and suitably, and among these distinctions is that inability is separate from ingratitude. For when the latter, through intemperate manners, leads to resistance, it tends to be detested, as is only natural, but when the former, because of the impossibility of performing a service, is driven to the same point, it deserves to be pitied.  
&gt;  
&gt;Permit this, O king, that, while we receive as our lot all the direst misfortunes, we may take with us this consolation at least, that we are spared a reputation for having been ourselves responsible for the things that have befallen us. As for money, consider that what you have taken is sufficient for you; think that their proper measure is not your rank, but the power of the Beroians. Do not force us beyond that, so that you not seem unable to accomplish your purpose, for excess is always punished by obstacles that cannot be overcome, and the best course is not to attempt the impossible. Let this, now, be my defense on behalf of these men. If I were able to converse with those poor sufferers, I might have something else also to tell you that has now escaped me.

Khosrow allowed Megas to enter the Acropolis. Upon realising the situation, Megas came before Khosrow in tears and lying prone on the ground, insisted that the Beroians had no money left and begged him to grant them their lives. Moved by this Khosrow spared the city. Few soldiers remained in the city. Most deserted to the Persians. Speculation is that Justinian had not paid the Limitanei in the east. Their low morale proved easy for most to defect to Khosrow. Khosrow upon hearing that the Antiochenes had refused to pay him, advanced upon Antioch, bringing Megas with him.

And who can forget when he scolded Flamininus for indulging himself with 'hellenic' customs and other things of that nature. 

But eventually, the Roman world became more adapted to Greek culture, roughly around the time of their campaigns in the east when Perseus was subdued and they had great cultural exchanges with Rhodes, Pergamum, and Bithynia.

So my question goes, for the Alani people that migrated west during  the Migration Period, and that settled in Central Hispania, plus the other Alani foederati settled in Gaul, do we know what religion did they practice? I know most germans were Arians, and that the Medieval Alans as well as their modern desceandants the Ossetians are Orthodox Christians. However I read somewhere that the Alans previous to their christianitzation practiced a religion somewhat similar to Zoroastrianism but with more polytheistic elements. But the ones that moved west into Rome were still of that religion or had already converted to some form of christianity?

Yeah I know it is an oddly specific question, but I am surprised as the Alans are the least talked about of all the Barbarians and I just want to know more about them. Also because I'm in an alternate history project and a part involved the Hispanic Alans so I want to be sure how they were.",ancientrome

1634746682,Flavius Eutropius: His rise and fall (395-399),"**His Rise**

We all know the chaotic last days of emperor Valens and the battle of Adrianopolis. This was the Rome where young Eutropius grew up. 

He was castrated as a child, becoming a eunuch slave to many prominent eastern officers. 

Fortune was on his side for when general Theodosius was considered illegitimate by the western court, Eutropius supported him, even going to Thebes to consult a Christian prophet who says that Theodosius will indeed win against Eugenius. 

Once Theodosius consolidated his hold on the empire; Eutropius became a powerful chamberlain in the palace of Constantinople. Already a distinguished and worldly man, he was respected by Theodosius and worked with Rufinus, the prefect of the east. 

Eutropius arranged a marriage between Arcadius and the daughter of a Frankish general, Bauto. She is Aelia Eudoxia, the famous empress who would have coins minted in her honor as well as statues.

He was quite crafty in doing this because, in reality, Rufinus wanted Arcadius to marry his daughter and thereby have more control over the weak emperor. This little matchmaking ability of Eutropius would elevate him immensely. Constantinople was his.

He would then tell Arcadius to relax, put his feet up, and travel to Ankara, Galatia, and other places, leaving him free to rule the eastern court more effectively. While Eudoxia had problems of her own, particularly with John Chrysostom, archbishop of Constantinople. 

Moreover, in Africa a revolt of the magister militum per Africam, Gildo, seriously put the empire in trouble and the Senate declared him an enemy of the state, frustrating Stilicho, who already had much on his plate. 

Eutropius felt he couldn't handle everything at once, especially the rampaging army of Goths in the empire headed by Alaric who he made a truce so that he can focus on the Huns. Fortunately for him, the campaign against Uldin and his Hunnic army was a success and he likewise didn't have much trouble from the Persian king, Bahram IV, who likewise was threatened by the Huns. 

**His Consulship and fall**

The success of this campaign made him more popular in the east and so, through the approval of emperor Arcadius and the rest of the imperial court, he became Roman Consul in 399.

One might ask why didn't one of the tough military commanders become consul instead? After all, even Dagalaifus, Bauto, Meroubaudes, and Stilicho became consuls at one point. But this was because Eutropius held all the cards at the time and moreover, none of the other generals and officers had the ear of the royal family as much. The man was a cunning diplomatist. 

But Eutropius's appointment to the consulship didn't just anger the Roman senators and Ravannese court but also many officers in the east, including Aurelianus, former mayor of Constantinople, and a gothic general named Gainas, the latter being Magister militum of the east, through the promotion of Stilicho.

Moreover, Tribigild, leader of the Ostrogoths, hated Eutropius and so made an open revolt. He was assisted by Gainas and together the two forced Arcadius to sign a treaty allowing the Ostrogothic refugees to settle in the empire in return for fighting as foedratii. Another term was the resignation of Eutropius as consul.

Having few to turn to, he sought help from the archbishop of Constantinople, John Chrysostom, who had great influence over the people. But Aelia Eudoxia, the young girl he once arranged to marry Arcadius forced him to capitulate and had weak Arcadius agree to the terms.  

He indeed resign and was exiled to Cyprus. His successor was Aurelianus, who confiscated his property and had his statues destroyed.",ancientrome

In AD 174, a sizable contingent of the Roman army was saved from destruction by the timely arrival of a violent rainstorm. This fascinating celestial event is recorded in numerous ancient sources as well as carved in stone upon the Column of Marcus Aurelius. Which god was responsible for this supposed miracle has been a matter of debate since antiquity with sources like Tertullian, Cassius Dio and Apollinaris of Hierapolis weighing in.

We are introduced to the Cimbri and the Teutones. 

Then Caesar tells us about the Ubii, Cherusci, Suevi, Marcomanni, and even the Dacians, of all people.  

Then later we start hear about the Batavians, the Chatti, Bructeri, and then much later, for some reason, we hear about the Franks, Vandals, Goths and Quadi. 

The eastern enemy is always more clear and direct. We start of with Antiochus the Great, move over to Tigranes and the Armenians, who are still with us today, and then we start seeing more Parthian action. Eventually, the Persian people rise up and establish the Sassanid dynasty and that's that. They later get crushed by the Arabs, who Theophanes says were once ""tributaries of the Persians"" in his *Chronographia* written in the 800s.

But even Livy mentions the Arabs and their archers in the Battle of Magnesia so there is a very broad discussion about them. 

But eventually, we stop hearing about the great Numidian cavalry, about the Cimbri, the Cherusci, the Marcomanni, the Chatti, the Quadi, even later groups like the Goths and Vandals.

A wide-end on the stylus, or an apart spatula, would be used in order to rub the wax and delete the text so that something new could be written.

Leather pieces were identified by archaeologists as wax tablet cases. So far i have gathered information about three very similar finds from Vindonissa, Switzerland); Vindolanda, UK; and a third one from unknown provenance. The three of them share size (they differ only by a few cm in lengh), shape and ""decorative"" pattern.

For the cases construction two layers of leather are glued (for which i use collagen glue) and then sewn together with geometrical patterns through very small stitches using a saddle seam. Then narrow strips of leather are used to cover the seams that keep the body and side panels together. 

The leather i used is very high quality vegetable tanned leather from Argentina. The thread is pure linen. And the dyes are natural: for the red i used Rubia tinctorum (aka madder), and atrementum sutoris for the black.

1634404659,What caused the collapse of Roman Paganism? Some surprising clues from Julian the Apostate.,"&amp;#x200B;

[Fourth Century AD fresco from the Via Latina catacombs in Rome showing Jesus approaching the tomb of Lazarus.](https://preview.redd.it/98wkleoefut71.jpg?width=842&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba4a650cfaac9f060163f03ad5377e84b5c72c99)

Why did Roman paganism collapse in the 4th century AD, and why did so many Roman pagans eventually flock to Christianity? Some fascinating evidence may be found in the surviving works of Julian the Apostate. Considering he was a Christian himself (indeed, he was the nephew of Constantine the Great) who reverted to paganism, Julian is able to offer some unique insights into what the average Roman found so attractive in Christianity, and why paganism seemed so moribund by comparison. In his letter to Arascius, pagan high-priest of Galatia, written in AD 362, Julian offers advice on how to revive pagan practices, while inadvertently revealing some of the weaknesses inherent in paganism and the contrasting strengths of Christianity:

&gt;The Hellenic religion \[that is, paganism\] does not yet prosper as I desire, and it is the fault of those who profess it; for the worship of the gods is on a splendid and magnificent scale, surpassing every prayer and every hope. May Adrasteia \[a pagan goddess\] pardon my words, for indeed no one, a little while ago, would have ventured even to pray for a change of such a sort or so complete within so short a time. Why, then, do we think that this is enough, why do we not observe that it is their benevolence to strangers, their care for the graves of the dead and the pretended holiness of their lives that have done most to increase atheism?”

Those people surely must have felt proud to be part of the Roman empire, but if we recall, even in the days of Honorius and Valentinian there were strong leaders like Stilicho, Aetius, and Majorian.",ancientrome

""Politicized Romans often had a visceral reaction to the fall of defeated generals, politicians, emperors and members of the imperial family that frequently involved the destruction of statues, the defacing of coins, and the erasure of inscriptions. Furthermore, it sometimes became a matter of imperial policy for newly-elevated emperors to call for the annihilation of all images of their opponents, the melting of imperial coinage bearing the likeness of the disgraced, and even making the utterance of the disgraced person's name a crime worthy of severe punishment. This is known by the more modern term *damnatio memoriae*, and it was a reasonably common feature of Roman political life. Though the phrase itself was not used in antiquity, *damnatio memoriae* has come to encompass the variety of censures that a disgraced individual might posthumously suffer.""

Some specific examples of this destruction of images by Roman mobs from Cassius Dio, Pliny, Herodian, Lactantius, and others may be found here:

1633969947,Contemporary depictions of Spartacus,"Hello guys,

I’ve read quite a bit about Spartacus and the Third Serville war. Spartacus definitely was a known person in ancient Rome but his reputation also wasn’t positive, so it’s clear that there probably were no monuments build to honor him.

What’s known about his person is that he probably was a Thracian mercenary (there’s some debate about him being the Gladiator class Thraex instead of him being a Thracian) who somehow got enslaved and was owned by Lentulus Batiatus in Capua and fought as a Gladiator in the Murmillo class.

My first question is if there’s any known contemporary or antique depiction of Spartacus as a Gladiator or slave.

After his escape from the Gladiator school Spartacus quickly became the leader of the escaped slaves.

This leads to my second question; are there any contemporary depictions of Spartacus as the revolt leader or of other leaders of the Third Serville war like Crixus or Oenomaus?

If anyone knows contemporary or antique mosaics/reliefs etc that could depict Spartacus I’d greatly appreciate you leaving a comment here :)",ancientrome

We know that at this time there was the bloody campaigns in the Iberian peninsula and also the attempt to pacify Carthage and Greece as much as possible. 

But surely the Romans must have heard of the immense force that happened to swallow up their rival empire. The Seleucids were in a civil war and as a result of this, their empire was fragile. 

Or how about when Demetrius II was captured by the Parthians? That must have been quite interesting.

Picking out the most effective Roman rulers from the first through third centuries has been a topic of discussion and debate since antiquity. If you read *The Caesars*, an ancient satire written by Julian the Apostate, you know that even emperors were keen to have that conversation.

But what of the Christian emperors? The 4th through 7th centuries are often considered periods of decay and decline for the Roman Empire. I view them, however, as times of crisis and regeneration, as the previously pagan Empire was transformed into an amazingly resilient Christian Empire which persisted for another millennium despite attacks on all sides and myriad convulsions from within.

Who were the most effective rulers during this period? Opinions vary, but here are my choices. Portraits of all, taken from antiquity, may be found in the above image. A brief biography of each may be found here:

His ‘Meditations’ isn’t a philosophy book but a bunch of random thoughts he has and just writes them down. No overall message, no deep meaning. Might as well scroll through r/lifeprotips.

Obviously his biggest failing was his heir, he could have just adopted a more capable man as heir as was custom but he allowed his son to succeed him.

He managed to stop the revolt of Saturninus up in Germania, he managed to pacify Britain, fortify the limes, banned child trafficking, emboldened the office of censor, etc...

Juvenal in his 4th Satire writes that Domitian is a *Nero Calvus*, a bald Nero. But at the same time, he seems to have much more military capability than Nero or, at any rate, capable military generals such as Agricola, Trajan, etc...

Martial talks about how much more extravagant things are especially due to the Colosseum. But we also have the sanctuary of Isis in the Campus Martius as well as more obelisks. In short, there was a gradual growth of eastern culture during Domitian's era that wasn't so noticeable in the earlier Julio-Claudian period.

Their arms can make a bit more sense considering they have their shield in one hand and the sword in the other so it makes sense that they wouldn't need to worry about someone stabbing at their arms.

But what about their legs? Like what was up with them just having completely exposed unprotected legs? Especially since they are heavy infantry wouldn't they want to have protection down there as well, since if they go up against someone with a spear they could just poke down at their legs.

I don't know this question has been bothering me and google hasn't really given my the answers I have been looking for.",ancientrome

1633644031,The admiration for the Gordians was Rome yearning for its glory days,"If Gordian actually was able to make it out of Africa and install a dynasty in Rome, we could have perhaps have seen the empire stabilize. He was old and would be followed by his son, Marcus. 

The Roman people didn't like Thrax because he was a brute barbaric soldier who didn't at all resemble the ideal Roman. They also knew that Alexander had no heir left and that it was also high time for a completely different family to rule Rome. 

They liked the Gordians because they resembled the principate leaders. They had titles, he was once governor of Britannia, consul with Elagabalus, as well as an aedile who threw splendid games. He grew up in the age of Marcus Aurelius which, despite, being dead for fifty-five years, was still fondly remembered and admired. 

Why did everybody demand Pupienus and Balbinus, hated as they were, to adopt Gordian III as emperor? Because by this period, there was immense contempt for senators, especially those two. 

But then again, why didn't Timesitheus just kill or imprison Gordian? Wasn't it better to be the Augustus instead of letting some kid do it? Especially when you have to deal with the brutal Sassanids next door.",ancientrome

You would think that the housing market would go up since so many damn people probably wanted to get the hell out of the dangerous provinces and settle into Italy. When I say Italy, I mean below the Rubicon. We're not counting Mediolanum, Aquilea, and the cities on the Po.

I figured the property values went up in Rome but at the same time what about the suburra and all of the insulae? I bet that place got really dirty in the crisis. Especially after the plague. 

We hear about Cornelius Saecularis yelling at the church deacon Laurentius to hand over the church's money to him and we also have the story of Decius persecuting all the Christians in Rome so I would imagine that by that time, there was a lot of low-income people who the church helped. 

But let's keep in mind that Aurelian also did some great work in Rome, restoring the baths of Caracalla, fixing roads, and, of course, adding the Aurelian walls. So its not like Rome was all dirty and gross. 

But at the same time, how many people were actually producers? Think of all the people on the dole, all the slaves, and all the women and children. This makes me think that around the third century, only about 15% to 20% of the people within the Aurelian walls were actually property owners. 

Why did they have to build a bathhouse? Couldn't the urban prefect push for more affordable housing? Or at least put regulations on patricians building all these nice gardens for themselves that take up so much space?",ancientrome
1633617834,Emperor Justinian fails to dissuade Khosrow I from his invasion,"For those out of the loop, you can check out my post here, 
[539 AD, the year before Khosrow I initiates his invasion. He is seen receiving the envoys of Gothic and Roman armenians](https://www.reddit.com/r/ancientrome/comments/pzqio4/here_is_an_interesting_dialogue_of_gothic_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

With that, i return to my previous narrative, In late 539 or early 540, Emperor Justinian perceiving Khosrow’s desire for war, sent him a letter through a man named Anastasios. Not to be confused with Emperor Anastasios. 

Justinian to Khosrow I, 

“It is the mark of men  
of discretion and of those  
who practice their religion,  
when causes of war arise, especially  against men who are their true friends,  to exert all their power to prevent them;  but it belongs to foolish men and those  who, in their lives, make light of religion  to devise occasions for war and turmoil  that have no real existence. 

To destroy peace and initiate war is not  a difficult matter, as the nature of things  is to make the most wicked activities  easy for the most dishonorable men. But  when they have brought about war  according to their intention, to return  again to peace is for men, I think, not  easy. 

You charge me with writing letters that  were in fact not written with any dark  purpose and you are eager to interpret  them arbitrarily, not in the sense in  which we intended them when we wrote  them but in a way that will be of  advantage to you in your eagerness to  carry out your plans behind a smoke  screen.  

But for us it is possible to point out that  your al-Mundhir recently overran our  land and performed outrageous deeds  in a time of peace, capturing towns,  seizing property, massacring and  enslaving a great multitude of men,  concerning which it is not your part to  accuse us but to defend yourself. 

For the crimes of those who have done  wrong are made manifest to their  neighbors by their acts, not their thoughts.  Even with things as they are,  we have still decided to hold to peace,  but we hear that in your eagerness to  make war upon the Romans you are  fabricating accusations that do not  bear  on us at all.  

Naturally enough, for those who are eager to preserve the present order of  things reject even those accusations  against their friends that are most compelling, yet those who dislike the  institution of friendship are drawn even  to pretexts that do not exist. But this  would not be becoming even to ordinary  men, much less to kings. 

Setting these things aside, think on the  number of those who will be killed  
on both sides in a war and who will  justly bear the blame for what happens;  consider also the oaths you took when  you accepted the money and consider  that, if you wrongly dishonor them by  tricks and sophistries, you would still not  be able to avert them,  for God is too mighty to be deceived by any man.”

Khosrow, after reading the letter was silent for a while before compelling Anastasios, the messenger to stay alongside him. 

Khosrow invaded the Eastern Roman Empire along the Euphrates river in around May 540AD.

Maybe an unpopular opinion as Aphrodite is more known, but Isis cult was bigger than Venus apparently, that might not define it straightforward though. Venus was popular among Romans due to Caesar and his family and the Aenied.

1633370512,Roman Empire was half Mythology half Christian,"Christianity was allowed by the Romans or at least tolerated from 30 AD to 64 AD. From then, even before all the way to 250, Roman Paganism was dominant at every way of course, until 250 when it was still the dominant religion but Christianity started to flourish in the Roman Empire until 297 for nearly 40 years, until Empreror Diocletian launched a last attack on Christianity to persecute it, this became the case until 313, when Constantine allowed any Roman to follow whatever religion they wanted. So Christianity again started to flourish even more seriously until it became the official state religion in 385. And this lasted till the fall of the western Roman empire. 



So when I think of the Roman Empire, I think of initially Mythology dominating the state, until Christianity started to rise around 250 seriously. So I also think the end of the Roman empire represented Christianity. 


This just makes Imperial Rome even more fascinating. Half Mythology, Half Christian. And also this is my view on it.

The arrangements were made as follows. In the center of the lake, there had first been lowered the great wooden casks used for holding wine, and on top of these, planks had been fastened, while round about this platform taverns and booths had been erected. Thus Nero and Tigellinus and their fellow banqueters occupied the center, where they held their feast on purple rugs and soft cushions, while all the rest made merry in the taverns. 

TACITUS

In point of extravagance and notoriety, the most celebrated of the feasts was that arranged by Tigellinus; which I shall describe as a type, instead of narrating time and again the monotonous tale of prodigality. He constructed, then, a raft on the Pool of Agrippa,​ and superimposed a banquet, to be set in motion by other craft acting as tugs. The vessels were gay with gold and ivory, and the oarsmen were catamites marshaled according to their ages and their libidinous attainments.

1633181499,89 AD: The Revolt of Saturninus - Civil War averted,"Legio XIV Gemina and Legio XXI Rapax proclaimed Lucius Antonius Saturninus as their new Augustus. He was the governor of Germania Superior and had a massive force behind him. 

This was another example of a dissatisfied officer who hated the emperor, similar to Vindex in Nero's days, which many people at the time remembered. Domitian was paying subsidies to the Dacians and preventing any generals from advancing in their careers. Saturninus sought help from the Chatti but they were disorganized and the Rhine was not frozen which made things more difficult for them. 

But more importantly, when this rebellious officer erupted and proclaimed himself emperor, nobody really backed him. The governor of Germania Inferior, Lappius, went up with his troops and this was also followed by troops in Rhaetia and even from Hispania, commanded by Trajan. 

The rebellious army of Saturninus was put down and the leaders were beheaded. Finally, Domitian ordered his officers to send their decapitated heads to Rome and when they arrived, he had them placed on the rostra in the forum so everybody can see.

1633159333,Here is an interesting dialogue of Gothic and Armenia ambassadors coming to the court of Khosrow I trying to persuade him to invade the Eastern Roman Empire,"In around 539, the Ostrogoths now being pushed out of most of their holdings in Italy due to the recent conquests of the general Belisarius, desperation sought them to send envoys to sneak past the Eastern Roman Empire’s borders to the Sassanian empire in which by now Khosrow I had managed to stabilize his empire and is looking for a pretext to end the “eternal peace treaty” first signed between him and Emperor Justinian during Khosrow I early unstable years. 

Khosrow I needed to stabilize his reign, so signed the peace treaty. The gothic envoys appearing in his court gave Khosrow much assurances to break off the treaty with the Romans. Here’s the dialogue as follows,

“In general, O king, all other envoys set  out on embassies to gain some  advantage for themselves, but we have  been sent by Vittigis, the king of the  Goths and Italians, in order to speak on  behalf of your rule; and hear us as if he  were now present before you speaking these words. 

If anyone were to say, O king, putting it all in a word, that you have given up  your kingdom and all your men to  Justinian, he would be speaking  correctly. 

For he is by nature a troublemaker, he covets things that in no way belong to  him, and is unable to abide by the  settled order of things, so he has  conceived the desire of seizing the  entire earth and is eager to acquire for  himself each and every state. Accordingly, as he was not able to  attack the Persians on his own nor, with  the Persians opposing him, to move against the others, he decided to  deceive you with the smoke screen of  peace and, by forcing the others into  subjection, to acquire mighty forces to  use against your state. 

He has already destroyed the kingdom  of the Vandals and subjugated the  Moors while the Goths stood aside for  him because of their friendship; now he  has come against us with vast sums of  money and many men.  

It is evident that, if he is able also to  crush the Goths utterly, he will march  against the Persians with us and those  he has already enslaved, neither considering the name of friendship nor  respecting any of his sworn promises.  So while some hope of safety is still left  to you, do not do us any further wrong  nor suffer it yourself but see in our  misfortunes what will a little later  happen to the Persians. Consider that  the Romans could never be well-disposed to your kingdom; when they become more powerful they will not  hesitate at all to display their enmity  toward the Persians.  

Use this option while it presents itself  now, so that you not regret it after it has  passed.  For when the moment  of  opportunity passes, it is not in its nature  to return again. It is better by  anticipating to be in security, than to miss your chance and suffer the most miserable fate at the hands of the enemy.”

Events were also sparking up in the Caucasus region of Roman Armenia, a smaller portion partitioned between the Persians. The Persians controlled a bigger portion of Armenia. 

There was a man by the name of Akakios who was Proconsul Armenia Magnae from 536-538/39. He was considered a man of treacherous character in which described by Procopius framed his former predecessor Amazasp of wanting to give territories to Theodosioupolis and other fortress to the persians. He was later executed. He was appointed in the position from 531-536. 

The man Akakios proceeded to in Procopius’s words,” Plundered their properties without excuse and imposed on them an unheard of tax of four Kentanaria. But the Armenians unable to bear him any longer, conspired together, slew Akakios, and fled for refugee to Pharangion.” 
 
Magister Militum Praesentalis Sittas (530-538/39) who distinguished himself in the early wars between the Romans and Sassanians during the rule of Emperor Anastasios and Kavad I was sent to quell the uprising. At first he sent promises to the Armenians and was trying to avoid conflict. However Justinian reproached the man for his hesitance and Sittas was forced to engage the Armenians in battle. 

The battle was not a big one. A skirmish between them in a small cavalry battle with a river between both cavalry armies. General Sittas was killed. Describes as follows by Procopius, “ The enemy  advanced upon him with great  eagerness and a soldier overtook him in  the ravine and struck him a glancing blow with his sword on the top of his  head; he took off the whole scalp but  the steel did not injure the bone at all.  

Sittas continued to press on still more  than before, but Artabanes, the son of  Ioannes of the Arsakids, rushed him  from behind, thrust his spear at him, and  killed him. Thus Sittas was removed  from the world for no good reason and  in a manner unworthy of his valor and  continual achievements against the  enemy, a man who was handsome in  appearance, a capable warrior, and a  general second to none of his  contemporaries.”

The Roman Armenians therefore sent their own ambassadors to Khosrow I. Here is the dialogue, 

“Many of us, Master, are Arsakids,  descendants of that Arsakes who was  not unrelated to the Parthian kings  when  the Persian realm was under the power of the Parthians, and who proved  himself an illustrious king, inferior to  none of his contemporaries.[184] Now  we have come before you as all of us  have become slaves and fugitives, not,  however, by choice but because we  have been compelled.  

It might seem that this was because of  Roman power but in truth, O king, it is  because of your decision. If, that is, he  who gives the means to those who wish  to do injustice justly bears the blame for  their misdeeds. 

Now we will go over past events so that you can follow their whole course. Arsakes, the last king of our ancestors,  abdicated his throne willingly for Theodosios, the emperor of the  Romans, on condition that all who  belonged to his family for the rest of  time should govern their own lives and,  in particular, should be subject to no  taxation.[185] 

And we have preserved the agreement until you, the Persians, made this  notorious treaty that, we think, it would  not be wrong to call a pact of universal  destruction. From that time you have disregarded both friend and foe, and  that man who is in name your friend, O king, but in fact your enemy has turned  everything in the world upside down and  brought complete confusion. 

You yourself will realize this quickly, in fact as soon as he is able to subdue  completely the people of the West. For  what thing that was previously  forbidden has he not done? Or what  was well established that he has not  shaken up? 

Did he not ordain for us the payment of  a tax that did not exist before, and has  he not enslaved our neighbors, the  Tzanoi, who were autonomous, and has  he not set over the king of the wretched  Lazoi a Roman governor, an act neither  in keeping with the natural order of  things nor very easy to explain in  words? 

Has he not sent generals to the men of Bosporos, the subjects of the Huns,  taking over the city that in no way  belongs to him, and has he not made a  defensive alliance with the Ethiopian  realms, which the Romans had never  even heard of before? He has taken  possession of the Himyarites and the  Red Sea and is adding the Palm Groves  to the Roman realm. 

We omit to speak about the sufferings of the Libyans and the Italians. The whole  earth is not large enough for the man; it  is too small a thing for him to conquer  all  people together. But he is even looking  in the heavens and searching in the  nooks and crannies beyond the Ocean,  wishing to gain for himself some other  world.[186]

Why, then, O king, do you still delay?  Why do you respect that most evil  peace, just so that he may make you the  last bite of all? If you want to know what  kind of a man Justinian shows himself  to those who yield to him, an illustration  is to be found near at hand: ourselves  and the wretched Lazoi. If you wish to  see how he tends to treat those who are  unknown to him and who have not done  him the least wrong, consider the  Vandals, Goths, and Moors. 

But the chief thing has not yet been  said. Has he not made efforts in time of  peace to win over by deception your  slave, al-Mundhir,  O most mighty king,  and cause him to break away from your  kingdom? Has he not tried recently to  win over Huns who are utterly unknown  to him, in order to make trouble for you?  

Yet a stranger act than this has not been  done in the whole of time. For since he  perceived, as I think, that the overthrow  of the western world would speedily be  accomplished, he has already begun to  make plans against you in the East, as  the Persian power alone has been left  for him to grapple with. 

The peace, therefore, as far as concerns  him, has already been broken for you,  and he himself has put an end to the  Endless Peace. For those break a peace,  not who are the first to arms, but who  are caught plotting against their  neighbors in a time of peace. The crime  has been committed by him who  attempts it, even though success  eludes him. 

As for the course the war will follow, this  is surely clear to everyone.  For it is not  those who furnish causes for war, but  those who defend themselves against  those who furnish them, who tend to  conquer  their  enemies. In fact, the  contest will not be evenly matched  for  us even in point of strength.  

As it happens, the majority of Roman  soldiers are at the ends of the earth, and  as for the two generals who were the  best they  had, we come here having  slain the one, Sittas, and Belisarios will  never again be seen by Justinian. For  disregarding his master, he has  remained in the West, holding the power  of Italy himself. So that when you go  against the enemy, no one at all will  confront you, and you will have us  guiding the army with goodwill, as is  natural, and with a thorough knowledge  of the country.”

1633015967,Small unit actions in the Roman Army,"I'm not too up and up on Roman History, but I have seen a few things on how their army operates.  Everything I've read though, across all ages, deals with larger-scale combat - big pitched battles, sieges, things of that nature.  These are events where soldiers - be they old-style semi-hoplite-esque, Marian reform recruits, or late Imperial types - are in full battle-rattle and making use of all their tactics, techniques, and procedures like we'd expect.

Do we have any surviving commentary on small unit actions, however?  Things like foraging parties defending themselves, raids, rear-guard, etc?  Do we know what unit types deployed, how much equipment was expected to be fielded, or what sort of tactical approach was advised?

This is driven by wargaming as well as general interest - I'd recently pondered using a system like Lion Rampant to do small-scale skirmish battles in Roman AORs, which got me thinking about the sorts of scenarios involved in games of that small a scale and what kind of troops a thoroughly professional force like Rome is famous for sends off on these kinds of operations.

- this shift did not happen due to foreign interference or invasion. It was a domestic phenomenon.

- this shift did not result in the Empire's downfall

- this shift was permanently successful

the only other example that comes to mind is 

- Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten, but 1) that wasn't the same 180 degree change to a different religion, like the Romans; and 2) he was ultimately unsuccessful

- Israelites during &amp; after their Babylonian Exile, but 1) that was just shifting from Canaanite polytheism to Yahweh monotheism, instead of a total religion change; and 2) they were not an empire.

1632824916,Good books about ancient Gods as psychological forces?,"tl;dr 1. What are the most striking examples that come to your mind, within any (ancient) mythological tradition, in which Gods are clearly performing the role of (unconscious) psychological actors within human beings?

2. What are good books in which the Greco-Roman Gods are defined, systematized and explained in psychological terms, preferably on the basis of source material?

Dear all,

In the first book of the Iliad, a chuckling king (and tyrannical leader of the Greeks) Agamemnon tells his best warrior, Achilles, that he is taking the slave girl Briseis as his own war booty, even though Achilles had claimed Briseis earlier. As Achilles gets rowdy and starts to defy his king’s decision, the king doubles down on his decision, leaving little room for doubt as for who is in charge: ‘Sit down, Achilles, I am the king and I can do whatever I want.’ Achilles is blinded by rage, puts his hand on his sword and is about to charge Agamemnon and cut him down, but then the Goddess Athena flies down from the Olympus and literally ‘pulls Achilles back by his hair’, making him reconsider; he slides his sword back into its shaft. Reason overcomes blind rage.

Now, some people seem to assume that the Greeks literally believed that there were Gods living on a mountaintop (the Olympus), invisible to the humans as it is surrounded by clouds. But the Olympus is ***not*** surrounded by clouds many days of the year (during the summer): They could easily see that there weren’t actual ‘Gods’ living there. And the ancients weren’t idiots...

It is clear through the above example of Athena that the Gods were a way to explain our human condition, and that the ancients ***needed*** the Gods to explain one key element within this condition: The fact that we are limited, that we are at the mercy of forces we do not understand. These forces can be natural, i.e. macrocosmical (lightning, rain, earthquakes etc..), but also psychological: For what the hell do we know about why we are the way we are? Why do we think about the things we think about? Thoughts just seem to pop up into our heads. Why do we love who we love? It seems as if there are deeper, unconscious forces underlying our beings. As Jung, Neumann and others put it: We don’t own our thoughts, our thoughts own us.

Next steps down this rabbit hole include e.g. the realisation that we can ‘negotiate’ with these forces, making sacrifices to them, or the sensation that the ***micro***cosmical force (i.e. the God(dess)) which brings about certain psychological states, is but a manifestation of the same ***macro***cosmical force that e.g. makes the crops grow, the wind blow, the Sun shine etc. (cf. Lucretius’ first verses of On the nature of things). They are perceived of as one and the same. But these are different matters.

Two questions for you:

1. Assuming the Greeks/Romans conceived of the Gods as such forces, I should really like to read some secondary literature on this topic. Are there researchers who have defined each God(dess) in psychological terms and listed examples of their acting on human psyches, preferably within Latin and Greek sources? E. R. Dodds comes to mind (‘The Greeks and the Irrational’), but what other books would you recommend in which ancient Gods are systematized and explained in psychological terms, parallel with source material.
2. What are the most striking examples that come to your mind, within any mythological tradition (from the Americas to Oceania), in which Gods are clearly performing the role of (unconscious) psychological actors within human beings?

They had in their mind this killer instinct for organizing and managing things so that everything would go smooth. A big part of that would be engineering, and while I don’t have a great fascination for engineering itself, I love how they understood that water and roads would be the backbone of their empire, and how they implemented this on a huge scale with methodic relentlessness. I like how their castra were always the same, how they built one each night, how each soldier had his shovel and two poles. I like how they standardized pretty much everything, and what kind of practical ingenuity they put in improving everything they could, from the heavy training wooden weapons to the raised blocks to cross the streets in Pompeii. They choose to borrow from others when they saw something better (like the gladius in Hispania), rather than be stuck with so-so traditions, because they were practical. They excelled in some things (engineering is one of those), but I think that their success was deeply rooted in the way they managed things, rather than what they did in this or that field or situation.

I’m pretty much in awe about that.

1632739677,Appreciation for Roman culture/history in the contemporary United States of America,"Here's my controversial post; some of you will be upset, but give me a chance to present my argument. 

In the contemporary United States, there is a lack of appreciation for Ancient Rome. This is unusual because the United States has been greatly influenced by Roman writers and leaders and its past politicians and people greatly appreciated the works of antiquity.

In England during the time of Elizabeth I and James; people were fascinated by ancient Rome. Shakespeare wrote plays on many of its noble figures as did Ben Jonson, Christopher Marlowe, Fletcher, among others. Even to this day, just a few years ago, the Globe Theater did a production of *Boudica* by Tristan Bernays, a modern playwright. 

In France, the story of the collapse of the Republic is much more well known, the paintings and sculptures by artists heavily reference ancient Rome. Even Albert Camus wrote a play on Caligula

Back in 17th century Holland, books by Cicero and Plutarch were being printed en masse and it was quite common for people to learn Latin despite folks speaking Dutch. 

In Venice, many of the famous operas by Vivaldi and Albinoni which almost everybody had access to were based either on Roman gods or Roman history. The same for Vienna in Mozart and Beethoven's time. Post-Soviet Germany also has a great appreciation for ancient Rome*.* 

But in the United States, the entertainment industry has little regard for ancient Roman history and culture. People tend to prefer modern fictional things such as Game of Thrones, Star Wars, Marvel, DC, Lord of the Rings, etc...  and tend to look at ancient Rome as something too archaic and boring.

Mozart's operas on ancient Rome are some of the most ridiculous things you will ever see. It's not based at all on real history. His operas based on Titus and Sulla resemble mostly domestic love dramas. But nevertheless, there was still this appreciation for ancient Rome and the heroes of that age. It was considered sensible to know about ancient Rome.

In the United States, the founding fathers all knew the works of the Roman writers. You were a nobody in early America if you didn't know the works of the ancient Greeks and Romans. 

Why did this go away?

The text’s defense of Christianity and its refutation of Epicureanism, contains the seeds of what was to come: the banning of all “superstitious” practices, the smashing of the statues, the padlocking of the temples, the absolute victory of the Cross, and of Christianity as the only “true” religion. ",ancientrome

1632160004,Why didn’t the Eastern Roman Empire take a more proactive stance during the Crusades?,"Though it had been in near-constant conflict with the Caliphate since the 8th century, Byzantium had developed a very contentious relationship with Crusader forces and often conducted separate military operations with completely different objectives, mostly holding the line in Anatolia. The Third Crusade was the best and perhaps last point in time when an alteration of this policy would have mattered, great victories at Iconium, Acre, Arsuf as well as the re-conquests of Cyprus and most of the Levantine coastline had proven that this campaign was not in vain. The unfortunate death of Frederick Barbarossa and subsequent withdrawal of his contingent meant that the overall force fell below 50 000 crusaders and could no longer hope to overcome the more numerous Arab armies without reinforcements. At the time the Eastern Roman Empire was still in a position to field around 60 000 troops and the deployment of even a third of that in support of King Richard and Philip’s drive to Jerusalem would likely have been enough to result in victory and potentially further action to the north and east, why did they not do it?",ancientrome

Compared to the later emperors of the 3rd century, who were basically forced to play on “nightmare” difficulty, Trajan, Hadrian, &amp; Antoninus all appear to have been playing on “easy” mode instead.","Don’t get me wrong, I love the Antonines, but with the possible exception of Marcus’s, their reigns were a cakewalk compared to those of later emperors. The devastating Antonine plague coupled with the long and arduous Marcomannic wars make Marcus’s reign the only one that even remotely approaches the calamity of the third century.

Though widely regarded as some of of Rome’s greatest emperors, Trajan, Hadrian, and Antoninus all had the advantage of inheriting an extremely stable empire from their successors, one which was not yet afflicted by constant usurpations, assassinations, barbarian invasion on multiple fronts, economic crisis, and secession. How would these men have performed as emperor had their reigns been as difficult as Gallienus or Aurelian’s? Unknowable as this may be, by not having their mettle tested by similar calamities, it is clear that these emperors enjoyed much easier reigns.

A Separate volume based around The Punic Wars, (About the years that formulated the rise of Rome and the fall of Carthage, from 264 and 146 BC. 43 years of war over a span of 118 years, due to the three Punic wars. Resulting in the destruction of Carthage, the enslavement of its population, and Roman hegemony over the western Mediterranean).

The expedition ended in a devastating defeat for the Athenian forces, severely impacting Athens.

And lastly, a volume(s) focusing on the fall of the Roman Empire.

1631599973,Antony and Cleopatra--an interesting turn,"Reading Duane Roller's biography of Cleopatra VII, one must feel a sense of admiration about how Cleopatra VII was able to use Roman powers to keep Egypt from annexation. 

As I read the book, I found an interesting claim in the book that late Ptolemies had been made Roman citizens somewhere before 59 BCE, thus Cleopatra VII herself was either born a citizen or granted citizenship when she was a little girl, making it actually legal for Mark Antony to marry Cleopatra. This fact would be illustrated by the fact that the Roman citizenship issue of Antony and Cleopatra's children was never raised, although, according to Roman law, a child of a Roman citizen and a foreigner who wasn't specially approved for the citizen to marry by the Senate would be a foreigner. 

If Cleopatra VII was really a naturalized or born Roman citizen, then many common assumptions about her relationship with Caesar and Mark Antony would be overturned......But she never used a Roman name in inscriptions, anyway, so whether Duane Roller was right would be unclear.",ancientrome

2. 3rd-Century Chinese officials seemed to see Antioch, not Rome, as the centre of Roman Empire; while 2nd-Century Chinese officials seemed to see Alexandria and Roman Empire as synonymous, as indicated in historical sources compiled by historians based on sources from that time. 
3. According to historical sources, around 100 CE, a group of Macedonian merchants visited China and Chinese officials mistook “Macedonia” as two different countries.",ancientrome

I found this weird and decided to try to find out if there was any truth to it but I can't find anything. As far as I can tell the Gauls lost that siege because they were not expecting an attack during such a heavy rainfall and were caught off guard not because of superstition.  

The show also makes it seem as if Vercingetorix was in the walls of Avaricum during the siege which again I cant find any evidence for and seeing as there are accounts that the romans committed a small genocide against the inhabitants its unlikely that he would have survived the attack which we know he very much did as he fights Caesar some time later. 

If anyone knows where what source they used as reference when making that claim or any other information that would be amazingly helpful.

1630873605,"Questions About the ""Conflict of the Orders""","Hello, I submitted this question to r/askhistorians a few days ago but got no responses so I decided I would try here instead.

I've recently been reading about the early to mid republic and I've seen the case made that the ""conflict of the orders"" was not nearly so clean as once thought. Supposedly, non-patricians served both as consuls and senators very early in the republic. This has left me with a feeling that I misunderstand the nature of classes in Rome.

What was the distinction between non-patrician and patrician gentes? Was it based solely around the patricians' ability to monopolize Rome's traditional priesthoods or were there other differences? Did this distinction evolve over time and when did the term plebeian begin to be used? Would patricians disdain a non-patrician who acquired high office (such as consul) or were they welcomed so long as they defended the interests of the ruling class? If it is true that non-patricians were initially barred from holding lower positions such as quaestor, why were they not barred from holding the more prestigious position of consul? As non-patricians became more common in government did those non-patricians in power come to be associated more with the ruling class or remain associated with their non-patrician status?

1630863955,455: The Year of Three Emperors,"If you thought the assassination of Alexander Severus and the subsequent war that followed was ridiculous, then we should see how crazy the year of the three emperors was. 

The bitter old senator, Petronius Maximus, fuming at the way things were going in the empire, decided to persuade the guards of emperor Valentinian III to kill him in the Campus Martius and declare himself Augustus right then and there in the city of Rome. There were many people who demanded Maximianus, the domesticus of Aetius to be emperor, but the stubborn Roman Senate, opposing everybody one last time, finally managed to install their candidate on the throne. 

It really goes to show how blind and ridiculous that body of men had become by the 5th century.  Not to mention Maximus knew a thing or two about throne usurpation since he basically did what Julianus and Otho did in their respective centuries. Bribe the imperial bodyguards and officials. 

He had Avitus as his Magister Militum and sent him up to the Goths in order to have their support. Of course, in between this, the Vandal king, Geiseric, infuriated by the cancellation of his son's marriage and the death of Valentinian decided to raise hell and invade Italy. 

Finally, the old man was finished off when a mob of people killed him and the empire remained in the hands of confused court officials and an apathetic Roman Senate. For a whole month there was no emperor. 

Finally, a letter arrived saying that Theodoric, king of the Goths, supports Avitus, the Magister Militum, as the new emperor. Of course, the Roman senate just shrugged their shoulders and went along with it. What else could they do? So then Avitus showed up in Italy with a contingent of Gallic and Gothic forces, planted them in Ravenna, and went to his ceremony in Rome.

1630201987,How Rome Fell by Goldsworthy - Thoughts,"So I just finished this book and it stirred up some new thoughts about the Fall of Rome, at least for me.  To start I highly recommend Goldsworthy's books on Rome as both readable but still having depth. I'd give it a B + with its only weakness being that is sometimes gets lost in the details and loses the broader narrative.

Anyways, one thing that struck me is inability of the later Empire to raise large armies or replace armies after defeats.  Indeed Roman generals seemed to avoid large scale battles.  Some hypothesize that this was caused by depopulation in Italy and the wider Empire.  Goldsworthy points out that we simply don't have the records to prove this, which is true.  But I couldn't help thinking of the numerous times in the Republic that Rome lost large armies but manage to come back and win by drawing on their reserves of manpower in Italy or the provinces.  The wars with Hannibal would be a prime example.  Huge losses and yet the Romans kept fighting after raising new armies.  In the later Empire the Romans could scarcely inflict a lasting defeat on any of the tribes attacking them.  At most they kept them at bay.  In the prior times they wouldn't have settled for anything short of a decisive victory.  I just can't help but wonder that the number of men needed simply weren't there to keep pushing for a lasting victory.  Some might say civil war had sapped Rome of men, but the Romans fought civil wars under Sulla and Caesar but still managed to protect their boarders shortly after.  Of course those civil wars ended and were followed by peaceful periods of stability.

Did some kind of agriculture decline lower the roman population?  Did taxation hurt the economy and lead to population decline?  Did the people of the Italian countryside not wish to fight as their forefathers had?  Were small landholding farmers turned into pseudo surfs who were not fit for soldiery?

I'm not really settled on any one answer here just thinking out loud.",ancientrome

1630083271,How did political purges work in the roman times?,"I was doing some reading on the fall of the Republic. It's funny because we modeled our own government off of Roman institutions but similar names only serve to confuse because of the fundamental differences. The senatorial class being hereditary, the way that political and military leadership were interchangeable and how you could have a senator in charge of a legion and that's just not the way things are done now. 

What kind of throws me is how mass killings seem to have been part of the political process. I see it hadn't been for like 400 years and the demise of the Gracchi Brothers brought it back and normalizing that sort of thing is what led to the fall of the Republic because there was no peaceful means of making political demands. 

I would tend to think that for their own well-being, the rich would have made it a point to minimize that sort of thing. Like even in the American Civil War, the Union didn't go about visiting ruin and destruction on the Confederate leadership after the fact. 

I'm just curious as to the public reaction to this at the time, the thoughts of the other elites who are having their safety directly threatened. I'm finding descriptions of what happened (victor proscribed enemies, 3000 killed) but nothing about the fallout. Like when Sulla did it, was this just like the Reign of Terror where people were too scared to speak out lest they become targets? I know after Stalin died the people who inherited leadership of the USSR were like ""Yeah, let's try to make stalinist purges no longer a thing."" The same dynamic seemed to have played out after the death of Mao and they'd managed power-sharing within the party itself until Poo Bear came along and managed to outmaneuver all of his opponents. Still, he's not gotten to the point of mass killing of political rivals among the party elite. 

Kinda rambled there but the question is basically how did contemporaries react to all the purges back then?",ancientrome

And the second, called the chapel of St. Petronilla during the middle ages, was originally the Tomb of Honorius.

Both are now demolished, and in the 15th century a few sarcophagi were uncovered from the Tomb of Honorius, but apparently not the one of the chicken emperor himself.

I already searched online (and on this sub) but the results mostly focus about the ""must see"" whereas I really would like a comprehensive list to visit over a few days.

I already planned to see Hadrian palace in Tivoli but that's about it.

Thank you very much !",ancientrome

1629909729,Favorite Emperor and why?,"Let’s become nerds and explain our favorite emperor and why lol. Mine is Leo lll.

He was responsible for the defense of Constantinople during the second Arab siege (717–718). Although he had taken power only a few months before the blockade, he effectively followed the steps of Anastasios II (r. 713–715) and saved the empire. During this siege the Greek fire (hugron pur) was used, the Golden Horn was closed with a chain for the first time (at least it’s the first time it is mentioned in the primary sources), and Leo contacted Khan Tervel of Bulgaria, whose intervention was crucial. Constantinople would never again get besieged by the Arabs.
He repelled the Arab invasions of Anatolia that restarted in 726 and defeated them in the battle of Akroinon (740), one year before his own death, where he personally commanded the Byzantine troops along with his son and successor Constantine V. The battle was of significant importance, as it marked the end of the period when the empire struggled for its survival and ushered the frontier war—along with the crisis the Umayyad Caliphate faced, of course.
In 726, he published the Ecloga, a new legal code, in an attempt to rectify Justinian’s legislation. The Ecloga is influenced by the customary law, especially that of the East, as well as the Christian value of philanthropy. Thus, it gave more rights to women and children and replaced the death penalty with mutilation for a number of crimes.
He fought against corruption and tried to restore the power of the state. He decreed that judges should receive a substantial salary, in hopes that that would make them less susceptible to bribery. N. Oikonomides has also suggested that by bringing the apothekai under the direct control of the state he attempted to control and supervise the economy more closely rather than let private interests have their way (however, his theory that the kommerkiarioi of the apothekai were private entrepreneurs until the mid 8th century is controversial).
It seems that during his reign as well as that of his son the Byzantine economy recovered from the crisis of the 7th century (e.g. after 668 copper folles had disappeared) and was gradually re-monetized. Thus, the state could once again receive most taxes in gold rather than in kind, which by the way is generally considered on of the elements that make a country “advanced.” W. Brandes in his Finanzverwaltung in Krisenzeiten argues that the Isaurians played a vital role in reforming the Byzantine economy.",ancientrome

Did he help carry it out in his portion of the empire or did he try to stop it?

Did he actually have any control over whether or not this policy was to enforced?

1629680537,Voltaire on the growth of the church,"Excerpt from Voltaire's Philosophical Dictionary Volume III

""We have ample testimony in Origen, Athenagoras, Theophilus, Justin, and Tertullian, that the primitive Christians held temples and altars in abomination; and that not merely because they could not, in the beginning, obtain permission from the government to build temples, but because they had a real aversion for everything that seemed to apply any affinity with other religions. This abhorrence existed among them for two hundred and fifty years, as is proved by the following passage of Minutius Felix, who lived in the third century....

...The Christians, then, had no temples until about the beginning of the reign of Diocletian. The Church had then become very numerous; and it was found necessary to introduce those decorations and rites which, at an earlier period, would have been useless and even dangerous to a slender flock, long despised, and considered as nothing more than a small sect of dissenting Jews.

It is manifest that, while they were confounded with the Jews, they could not obtain permission to erect temples. The Jews, who paid very dear for their synagogues, would themselves have opposed it; for they were mortal enemies to the Christians, and they were rich. We must not say, with Toland, that the Christians, who at that time made a show of despising temples and altars, were like the fox that said the grapes were sour. This comparison appears as unjust as it is impious, since all the primitive Christians in so many different countries, agreed in maintaining that there was no need of raising temples or altars to the true God.

Providence, acting by second causes, willed that they should erect a splendid temple at Nicomedia, the residence of Emperor Diocletian, as soon as they had obtained that sovereign’s protection. They built others in other cities; but still, they had a horror of tapers, lustral water, pontifical habits, etc. All this pomp and circumstance was in their eyes no other than a distinctive mark of paganism. These customs were adopted under Constantine and his successors, and have frequently changed.

There is not, perhaps, a single ceremony of this day that was in use in the time of the apostles. The Holy Spirit has always conformed himself to the times. He inspired the first disciples in a mean apartment; He now communicates His inspirations in St. Peter’s at Rome, which cost several millions—equally divine, however, in the wretched room, and in the superb edifice of Julius II., Leo X., Paul III., and Sixtus V.",ancientrome

I have just finished Mike Duncan's ""The History of Rome"" and I loved it. Before that I finished most of Kings and Generals videos throughout the Republic, into the Empire and during the Fall. 

I love Mikes podcast because its a ""full"" history. It starts at the beginning and tries as hard as it can to touch upon, as much as possible, everything that was going on within the areas in and around Rome. This gives good context to what is going on within a time period and allows you to understand why people made the decisions they did. 

Sorry for the rant. I am looking for a history of Europe after the fall of Rome. How did we get from Rome to Charlemagne to Author the Great? What was going on in Eastern Europe and Northern Africa and Spain during these times? I know these times are dark and not a lot of history was written. 

I am looking for a timeline based history. Not small blimps of themes such as this movement or this battle. Also any video series on youtube or podcast or really any network. 

And really while I'm at it, I need another timeline based history podcast or video series to listen/watch. If you have anything else that starts at a date and runs through history to another far away date as thorough as The History of Rome please suggest it too. Anything before the 19th Century.

1629298157,The Office of Magister Militum after Aetius,"The death of Aetius gives us a whole new period of Rome. The final closing chapter to the Western Empire. The office of magister militum (military master) perhaps reached its height in the years after he died. 

The list usually goes like this. 

* Remistus (*Avitus)*
* Flavius Ricimer (*Majorian, Severus, Anthemius, Olybrius,*)
* Flavius Gundobadus (*Olybrius, Glycerius*)
* Ecdicius Avitus (*Nepos*)
* Flavius Orestes (*Nepos*)

These men were the *de facto* head of government. When Valentinian gets killed, Petronius throws the whole empire into confusion. This was a perfect time for the Visigoths to try and put their preferred candidate in Ravenna and indeed they had a big role in it because they supported Eparchius Avitus, a military general in Gaul. 

Avitus's son, Ecdicius Avitus, would eventually serve also as magister militum under Nepos, an emperor with total support from Constantinople. But how and why Nepos switched Avitus for Orestes, I don't know. It could perhaps be that maybe Orestes just had more military experience and this was something Avitus didn't. 

Ideally, it could have been that Nepos would have liked to use Orestes' skills and diplomacy in taking down the Visigoths or perhaps the Vandals.",ancientrome

1629217588,How did wives feel about infidelity? How did men feel about the sexual double standard?,"Plautus and Seneca both criticized the sexual double standard of their time, and their is literary evidence to suggest that a husband’s infidelity caused strife and could be a reason for her wanting a divorce in the Roman empire. I believe it was the infidelity of Tullia’s husband (who was Cicero’s daughter) that caused their marital discord. 

Plutarch criticizes the Athenian statesman Alcibiades for his infidelities with heterae during his marriage to Hipparete, which forced her to present herself in front of the archon for a divorce. While that is ancient greece, Plutarch did have influence as a historian in Rome. 

So: how did wives feel about infidelity, and were their feelings validated by contemporaries?",ancientrome

They performed admirably in the year of V when it was Hispania/Britannica vs the rest (Rhine boys sitting it out) and again under Constantine III.

1629138222,Upset about Pompeii,"I’m just going to say that I’m upset. For the first time in my life I studied a good bit about Pompeii, and I compared the early photos with the most recent ones, and also the recent photos with the watercolors made just after the excavations more than 100 years ago. Well, most of the paintings and original colors disappeared. Sometimes, even plaster did. The beautiful pristine status is gone. I’m beating a dead horse, I know, but what a pity!

Also, most of the victims casts, objects and furniture were brought into museums. No accurate record of original positions exist (or it’s very hard to find).

So Pompeii is now mostly similar to any other ancient ruins site (say, the forum in Rome). Humanity had a unique chance, and botched it. Lots of features are lost forever. It’s a huge site and the excavations began before the inception of archeology itself, but alas, we couldn’t imagine anything better than stripping and leaving the walls to rot? What about at least providing some roofing to the most recent houses? Or, *displacing* a whole house into a climatized museum, replacing it on site with a replica? These seem blasphemous ideas, but good grief, they’re better than letting *everything* but the stone disappear in another century! I’m really upset.",ancientrome

Like presumably everyone here, I have a love for Roman history, both Republic and Imperial. I have recently started hungrily devouring books on Roman Emperors and Dictators, reading first Julian by Gore Vidal, then Caesar and Augustus, both by Adrian Goldsworthy. I have just finished I, Claudius and Claudius the God, both by Robert Graves. 

Trying to keep it short, what I’m looking for now are more recommendations of books I may enjoy, or books you yourselves have enjoyed. I want to be able to learn more about the rulers of Rome I am less familiar with, such as Trajan, Hadrian, and others. I’m not only looking for informative works, but can also enjoy ones where the authors note they may have taken some narrative liberties, such as in Vidal’s work.

1628898569,Is learning Italian first the best basis for Moving onto other Romance Languages? Also is Italian (or the various languages of Italy) the closest of the modern Romance family to Latin?,"I was told by a few multilingual language that Italian gives a basic middle ground between all the romance language in that for example while a Spaniard will understand a lot of Portuguese easily without any prior study,  he'd have a much harder time with French and won't understand most Romanian basics.

Italian on the otherhand not only has a lot of similar pronunciation to Spanish in addition to word but also shares a lot in common with French structure and in addition was deemed on a quick google to be the closest language to Romanian of the Romance family. And its a big help plenty and plenty of other romance languages such as Sicilian are within the modern Italian borders and islands nearby Italy as well as also in regions cross Spain like Catalan and various islands and port locations in the Mediterranean that were major trading hubs dominated by Italian merchants in the Medieval Ages.

So plenty of people tell me Italian is the best starting point as a result of being in the absolute center ground if you plan to specialize in romance languages. And its a big help that Italy is the capital of Catholicism and most cultures with Romance tongues are primarily Catholic and that Italy is one of the economic superpowers of modern times.

It is all for this reason I was also told that Italian is the closest to Latin of the existing Romance languages in their current form. So I was told specialize in Italian first if you intend to go deep into Ancient Roman studies because its the closest (and it does't help Italy is where the Roman Empire's heartland was so you'd have to learn it anyway if you start Latin language as a hobby).

How accurate is this?",ancientrome

1628358358,Child emperors post-Julian was the worst thing Rome did,"When Julian takes office. You get this breath of fresh air. Its like Rome has a real emperor again, he behaves like a princeps and reminds the people of Rome the virtue of their forefathers and of the sacrificed to Jupiter Optimus Maximus. 

After him, you either have a brute autocrat or an idiot child guided by a barbarian chief or unscrupulous regent. The truth is that by that time, Rome should have just culturally incorporated the Goths and Vandals into the emperorship. Somebody like Stilico should have been emperor in the same way Thrax did. 

I often look back and wonder how the Roman people fell in love with Alexander and the child Gordian. These were the last two child emperors before a long series of military leaders. This child emperor thing should have ended in the third century. The fact that it came back is just ridiculous. 

If I was a Roman citizen and heard that Gratian died and general Magnus Maximus has been elevated to Augustus, I would be thrilled. I would cheer him on to eliminate the rest of the Valentinians. 

You also have that brief period when Honorius dies and an actual stable adult man becomes Augustus again, but he is immediately removed and another child emperor is thrown in. 

Finally, the empire manages to get some semblance of stability when Julius Nepos takes over and becomes an official recognized emperor.  It's now been about twenty years since Rome had a child emperor. This was the ideal time for the empire to catch its breath and slowly recover. 

Gundobad had been succeeded by Orestes as magister militum and this is when that whole rebellion starts and poor little Julian flees to Dalmatia. 

This was nothing new. A magister militum taking power over the emperor? Lets recall how the Praetorian prefects used their power whenever they had a weak emperor. 

But what I think is interesting is that he chose to put another child as emperor. After twenty or so years of Rome having adult men with government experience as emperors, Orestes decides to put his infant son as emperor. 

I'm pretty sure that Odoacer, seeing all of this, thought ""enough is enough"". He could have simply usurped the office of Magister Militum and behave like Ricimer and Gundobad did to some weak ceremonial emperor. But honestly the man just wanted to get his troops paid and had enough of theatrics. 

If say, for example, Orestes wife paid him off and made him magister militum to her son Augustulus in Ravenna. Then you would have that whole shitshow all over again. I think he was right in deposing the emperor. We can't have Rome turn too much into a spectacle of a state.",ancientrome

Tarentum is a great city in the empire and the Festival of Dionysius there was among one of the most famous due to the party atmosphere of the Tarentines. They're practically rivaling Neapolis at this point...

Over in Magnesia, you have the Hetaerideia, a festival dedicated to Aphrodite Hetaera, where the prostitutes dine and sing for the whole town and go home with the men. 

But while you're in Greece, you don't want to miss the Panathenaic festival in Athens, by far one of the best festivals ever. Everybody who is anybody will be there and you surely don't want to miss the rhapsody competition, the Pyrrhic dances, the torch relay race, and the best of all, the boat races. How can you miss this event? To say nothing of all the after parties that happen afterward.

Let's cross the Aegean because we also don't want to miss Artemisia over in Ephesus. Pliny himself was blown away by this festival and everybody travels there to see the great theatrical performances and the magnificent artistic renditions of Artemis who is paraded throughout the streets.

You want to keep traveling, Paulus wants to go to the splendid island of Samos for the Heraia but Marcellus wants to go to Alexandria for the Serapia, the festival of Serapis. Everybody runs around the city and celebrates Serapis as well as Anubis and you see great statues and costumes of this unique Greco-Egyptian culture. There are also great comedic performances since the Alexandrines certainly are witty people.

When it comes to winter festivals, you decide to ditch Rome, it's getting way too touristy. Nobody really hangs out in Rome during Saturnalia anymore, we're not in the days of Cato. Everybody is heading south now and you go down to Sicily and city hop between Catania and Syracuse, only a short boat ride away and the weather is much better. Those two beautiful cities that Decimus Ausonius once called the only two cities in Sicily.

But perhaps it will be a good idea to attend the fire festival of Belenus up in Aquilea? Hmmm... it's not something popular and there is great beauty up in the Cisalpine Gaul with its delicious wine. Maybe next year...",ancientrome

Now while I understand that Rome's network of alliances throughout the peninsula allowed the city-state to tap into man reserves from many other city-states on the peninsula, that still doesn't answer the question as to how that Italian peninsula itself had such a seemingly large population relative to other mediterranean nations. 

For example, there were times when Ancient Greece was unified under alliance regimes or under Macedonian control for example. Egypt under the Ptolemies had a huge population. Persian empires had huge populations. 

How was it that Italy had so many people compared to these more ancient, and more developed/urbanized regions in the Eastern Mediterranean?  **Did** Italy actually have an enormous population or was it simply that all free males had a habit of military service whereas the military utilization rate was just far lower in all other contemporary civilizations?

1627344710,Avianius Symmachus - One of Rome's last great mayors,"Avianus Symmachus was a senator and came from a distinguished family. He was the mayor of Rome, *prefectus urbanus*, during the time of the elder Valentinian. This man had a lot of work to do. Mind you, 4th century Rome is no picnic. 

The old Pons Agrippae over the Tiber had been destroyed and he repaired so that the citizens can easily cross that region of the city once more. He made sure that the food supply was always good and was also a religious man who made sacrifices to the gods. 

During his term, his loyal friend, Praetextus, and other magistrates mounted the Capitoline in old Roman fashion and made sacrifices to the ancient gods. He took care that vestal virgins continue their tradition. 

Some of the plebs, however, hated him due to his frugality, a characteristic of Roman virtue, and decided to burn his house down because he would not lower the price of limes. He fled the city for a while and spend his time in writing and creative projects only to return by the Senate. 

Upon his return, he continued his term and the plebs that were involved in the burning of his house were punished. He later became consul and was also a good father, his son, Aurelius Symmachus, was one of the last true Romans to stand up to the Christianization of the empire.",ancientrome

1627163297,Would an Aurelian film be too edgy for society?,"I still haven't figured out why there hasn't been a large production focusing on the crisis of the third century. It's such an epic age. From the time of Marcus Philippus to Aurelian, its just chaos after chaos. Plus that 1,000 year old anniversary as well as the Persian capture of Valerian would make one big cinematic adventure. 

But as far as a protagonist goes. We have admirable men in Claudius Gothicus and Aurelian. A splendid tragedy, really. Why hasn't this been done? Is it too edgy for our modern society? 

Barbarians came out on Netflix and that was an excellent series. Gladiator, despite its flaws, wowed audiences. And, of course, you have Ben Hur and other such films.

In Shakespeare's age, people likewise admired the Julio-Claudians and Shakespeare wrote plays based on Julius Caesar and Mark Antony and his contemporary, Ben Jonson, wrote one on Sejanus. 

You also see this in the 1700s when people would attend operas that took place in Ancient Rome. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed an opera based on Titus and one based on Sulla, even though such operas were quite silly and had focused on love stories. There was also operas based on Scipio Africanus and Aetius that premiered in London composed by Händel. 

So its not like we are the only ones who admire the Romans. Think of how many people fell in love with Ben Hur when it came out back in the day. 

So why not a splendid biopic or grand production of Rome in the age of Aurelian? Is this time just way too edgy?",ancientrome

We live, we laugh, we like good food to eat, have our loves and rivals and petty jealousies. 

The differences... The whole view on homosexuality is different. It isn't gay if you're the top. And it's the act of being penetrated that's considered humiliating.

This also brings me to my second point. Marriage. 

We recall how Scipio Africanus in this similar time gave up his daughter Cornelia to the consul and famous tribune, Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus. Later on, we see Caesar doing something similar to Pompey, by giving him his daughter Julia in marriage. I can go on and on, Cato did it, Cicero did it, etc.... 

In short, you would always have these men of distinction bestowing their daughters on each other. Was this why all the young men who were single were seeing courtesans?

1626572204,The Greatest Roman Leader,"I have thought about this for a while, and I believe the greatest leader in the entirety of the Roman empire (atleast the western empire) was Octavian Caesar Augustus. He is the greatest because he was able to manipulate the Roman public into believing he was ruling over Rome as a elected official but he was an emperor and he began the shift into emporors commanding Rome. Augustus is also the greatest because he introduced the idea of having Auxilaries in the roman empire who historians believe was one of the greatest policies ever made in the ancient world. The ability to serve the roman empire for a set amount of time and retire as a roman citizen with money, land, and a community was unbeatable. Augustus also did many other great things for Rome and the world.

Some historians, such as Lintott, argue that there were in fact 2 separate bodies:   
1. Plebeian Council was a legislative assembly presided by the Plebeian Tribune and represented only plebeians.

2. Tribal Assembly was a legislative assembly  presided by consuls and consisted of tribes covering all of Rome's population 

Lintott cites as evidence for the existence of these 2 assemblies by pointing to laws passed by an Assembly presided by consuls.",ancientrome

Some people say it was Constantine that brought the shaved look again and it is indeed interesting to see how his successors also didn't sport a beard, except Julian. 

But once those two crazy brothers go up and split the empire again, you pretty much have a beardless imperial court. 

But the thing is that all those old Christian writers still had beards. They liked having beards, maybe it made them feel more saintly or like a wise philosopher or something. At any rate, you dont see the magister militums doing this either. They were clean shaven.

However I don’t understand why Gallienus is to blame for this. In the context of the era, Gallienus was constantly running around one end of the empire having to simultaneously fight off massive barbarian invasions and put down innumerable usurpers, the whole state was in shambles and the empire almost looked like it was on its last legs. Yet Gallienus managed to hold on by the skin of his teeth. I find it odd that even after already helping save Rome from multiple possible disasters, he was criticised because two of the dozens of usurpers managed to break away. I think he did pretty well considering everything he was up against. So why didn’t the Romans take this into account?",ancientrome

1625726572,The 'Gladius' of Tiberius,"The so-called Sword of Tiberius It perfectly embodies Roman visual language and political propaganda, tied up with Rome’s foreign wars and the imperial succession.The sword was discovered in 1848 near the river Rhine, outside the German city of Mainz, which in antiquity was a vast legionary fortress and military command centre for the German frontier.The scabbard is astonishingly well preserved and intricately detailed. The figurative scene on top is key to its meaning. In the centre is an enthroned male in classicising, divine garb with two attendant figures behind. Before him stands another male in military armour. They both have clear portrait features and were meant to be recognisable. The Museum’s own labels used to say otherwise, but having followed the heated arguments about its iconography and context over the years, I am with those who recognise here the Emperor Tiberius (r. AD 14–37), seated, receiving his adopted son Germanicus, commander-in-chief of the Roman army of the Rhine. The goddess Victory is to his left, and another deity, probably Mars, to his right. Clearly, this refers to a major military triumph in Rome's German wars. In truth, this is elaborate political spin, masterfully crafted both in intellectual concept and physical form. Under the Emperor Augustus (r. 27 BC–AD 14), three entire legions had perished in Germany. First Tiberius, and then Germanicus, led punitive expeditions that resulted in a series of inconclusive, ever more Pyrrhic Victories Tiberius was clever: seeing the futility of these wars, he simply declared victory, granted the ambitious, gung-ho Germanicus a triumph and recalled him to Rome. As Augustus’ stepson, Tiberius had long been overlooked for the succession and was then forced to accept Germanicus as his own crown prince in uneasy competition with the hugely popular, younger man.  One likes to think that this elaborate weapon belonged to a high-ranking officer, but this is by no means assured. What looks like gold and silver is in fact mostly tinned brass. The bigger story is clear – the new monarchy’s legitimacy derived in large part from constant battlefield victories, and the absolute personal loyalty of the new professional military was crucial. Giving to the troops a powerful message of wise leadership by a united imperial family helped achieve this, and the army had the craftspeople to do so beautifully.

1625442143,The Fall of the Western Empire re-interpreted as 751 AD,"We are often more familiar with the Western Empire once Attila fell. The years between 453-476. The murder of Valentinian, Vandal Invasion, Majorian's campaigns, etc...

But emperor Marcian and Aspar, despite breaking the Hunnic confederacy had a whole different situation going on for them. They had the Saracens and mighty Persia to their east. This was a place that had done many horrors to Rome, there was also Armenia to worry about and so they decided to focus on having better legions for a war against Persia and had the Ostrogoths and other tribes secure the Danubian frontier and granted them the title of Foederatii. 

Meanwhile, the temples were being taken down and the old classical world was coming to an end. His shrewd austerity gave the empire a large surplus of money, however. 

When Valentinian III died and Petronius Maximus took power in Rome, Marcian did not recognize him and both halves of the empire became divided more and more. But Marcian eventually died and Aspar was once again able to play kingmaker and so general Leo was chosen and he became Augustus in 457. This time the coronation was different and many Christian elements and sayings were added furthering transforming Constantinople into the ""Byzantine Empire"" we come to think of. 

But Leo still had to deal with the Huns, just cause Attila died doesn't mean the Huns disappeared. What about the Sarmatians? For this he had the Ostrogothic leader, Theoderic fight the Danubian tribes. Not only that but he was able to have Anthemius become Augustus in the West. Rome was back to being more united. 

With Attila gone, the western court was back to focusing on its two main problems; the Rhine border, the Visigoths, and the Vandals. In the Eastern court, Leo had killed Aspar, but in the western court, Ricimer killed Anthemius. Ravenna was increasingly slipping. 

He promoted one of his close friends, Julius Nepos to become the next emperor. By this time Ricimer was dead and his successor Gundobad wasn't as imposing on the western emperor, Glycerius, who readily abdicated when Nepos landed in Italy to become the next Augustus. However, this would not last long because he got into a disagreement with his general, Orestes, who took power and forced Nepos to flee to Dalmatia.

After Leo, Zeno the Isaurian, became emperor and, yet he had to deal with the revolt and usurpation of Basiliscus who took power in Constantinople. Already we have a de facto usurpation in the east and west.  

Finally, the city of Cosntantinople couldn't take the rule of Basiliscus and opened the city gates to the deposed Zeno and restored him to power. just as he was informed that over in Italy, there was a disagreement over Nepos and one of his generals, Orestes and that he had to flee to Dalmatia for fear of his life and that one of the Ostrogothic foederatii chiefs, Odoacer, deposed the usurper's son Augustulus and demanded the payment and lands that they were owed. 

Unable to handle many things at once, he granted Odoacer the title of *dux* but tried to have him recognize Nepos as the emperor, a bit like how things were back in Ricimer's days. 

But this didn't happen and Nepos eventually died not too long after. But Zeno had bigger things to worry about. There were so many non-foederati barbarians still running around that it's better to have an Ostrogothic be honorary king of Italy than to have rampaged by a more barbaric group. After that he sided with Theoderic, the darling of old emperor Leo who was brave at defending Rome's borders. 

He finally took Italy back through the help of Theodoric and this ushered in the rebuilding of many of Rome's old buildings as well as improving Ravenna. The court of Constantinople likewise became to flourish again after Anastasius became Augustus. 

In fact, Theodoric likewise became king of the Visigoths, uniting an empire stretching from Pannonia to Spain. To Zeno and Anastasius, this was still their realm. The Goths also hated the Vandals so this brought more animosity between Ravenna and Constantinople. 

It's only after Theoderic dies that this Gothic solidarity breaks and the Ostrogothic court in Ravenna start descending into disorder. The western provinces were becoming 'too problematic' and they had to be retaken no matter at what costs from those officers who technically were considered foederati but who have become sworn enemies. 

This is when Carthage becomes the Praetorian Prefect of Africa, it is back under Roman rule. In Italy, Ravenna becomes the capital city of the Praetorian Prefect of Italy. 

But remember the Gepids? Those people who were foederati's way back in Marcian's days? Those same Gepids rebelled against the Huns and protected the frontiers from invaders? Those people were eventually attacked by a new enemy, the Lombards. 

But these ""enemies"" were men who Justinian recruited in the reconquest of Italy from the Ostrogoths. Now the Lombards are making advances in Italy but by this time, the east was way too focused on other enemies, it lost Africa to the Muslims and Italy wasn't taken too seriously because of the incursions from Slavs, Avars, as well as the Sassanids right next door. 

Back in the old days we had the Visigoths, the Western Empire, and the Vandals, now we have The Rashidun, the Franks, and the Lombards. All of what remained in Constantinople's holding were Sicily and the southern portions of Italy. For me, this makes it seem like a more official collapse of the west.",ancientrome

Once I began studying the Byzantine Emperors more in depth I realized that they actually had a “informal but formal” plan for succession that was more more dynastic and hereditary than previous Emperors.

Even when I only knew very little about Roman Empire, the Byzantine always seemed more successful and it looks they actually had a proper established succession process, yes usurpations, coups, Familicide, and over throughs still happen but overall Byzantine seems more akin to other Dark Age monarchs with a royal court and a hereditary monarchy.

When we get to the Antonines, however, we see that the city has many people and they enjoy the circus races, performances in the amphitheater, and trade with the various peoples from the empire.

The city became a jewel for the rebellious usurpers of the third century. A rich city like Trier was to become a capital. Despite the usurpers coming to an end and Diocletian restoring order, there was no way that he would just shrug away this important city. He decided to likewise make it capital and when Constantine became emperor, he made this city all the more spectacular and made it the most important city north of Alps. This beautiful city became the residence of Constantius II, Magnus Maximus, Gratian, and also the birthplace of Ambrosius. 

Of course, the city of Arles in the south also received great recognition and the Constantines likewise favored it. When the time came that the Rhine frontier was too weak, the capital of the prefecture of Gaul was transferred from Trier to Arles. The usurper Constantine who co-ruled with Honorius, likewise knew that Trier was too unstable a city to be his capital and so he made Arles the seat of his government. 

At this time, Ravenna was also gaining prominence while Milan was still likewise quite strong. When we get to the assassination of Valentinian III, the city of Arles still holds strong and soon becomes a metropolitan archdiocese. Up in the north, the Franks have already taken over much of Gaul and the city of Trier was held by Count Arbogast who was a more Romanized Frank than his counterparts. 

Arles, on the other hand, was still around but it was becoming more and more separated from Italy. The Burgundians, Visigoths, and Franks made it too liable to Gallic forces. Eventually, a Gallic Roman officer named Avitus would be proclaimed Augustus in this city and it slowly became more and more detached from Italy. 

The emperor Anthemius, the puppet of Ricimer, just couldn't let this happen, he saw how powerful the Visigoths were becoming, but it was too late. The city of Arles was captured, Anthemius's son was killed, and the Romans lost complete control of southern Gaul. All that was left was Egidius up in the north trying to protect himself against multiple enemies. 

Later on, Arles was captured by the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy, but this likewise eventually gave way to the Franks. The Visigoths retreated into Spain and the Franks eventually made themselves master of Gaul and two iconic capitals of the Roman Empire, Trier and Arles.",ancientrome

1624661686,Why did the ancient writers love trashing people in their books?,"Have you noticed that? These guys just love trashing folks. 

Cassius Dio and Tacitus seem to do it a lot. Particularly when relating to previous Roman politicians of the past. They are not afraid to be poignant in their attacks too. 

Meaning that you get many Romans attacking other Romans but they do this all the time towards imperial administrators as well. Everybody just hates Narcissus, the eunuch of Claudius. I think he's great. Check out this passage from Dio. 

"" But finally, when he \[Claudius\] went down to Ostia to inspect the grain supply and she \[Messalina\] was left behind in Rome on the pretext of being ill, she got up a banquet of no little renown and carried on a most licentious revel. Then Narcissus, having got Claudius by himself, informed him through his concubines of all that was taking place.""

Like at one point I'm reading Livy's descriptions of the most iconic Roman battles but then you also have these little palace intrigues that occur later. The historians seem keener on idolizing the past and scandalizing the present and the overall post-Augustan age in general. 

The whole Claudius episode just feels like one big soap opera sometimes. 

As far as the later historians go, you definitely get a lot of shade from Zosimus and Ammianus. Herodian not so much. But then when you get to Procopius, its all shade again. 

In fact, the ancient writers always seem to speak in a way that they just blurt out their opinions. Why was this the case? Its almost like these books were uncensored and casually read.",ancientrome

1624557861,"Why is the Roman Legion generally seen as superior to their opponents in every way? Considering biased patriotic Roman historians such as Livy and Vegetius frequently pointed out the glaring flaws of the Roman military, how did this stereotype come to be?","Livy said:
&gt;Victory in war does not depend entirely upon numbers or mere courage; only skill and discipline will insure it. We find that the Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps and unwearied cultivation of the other arts of war. Without these, what chance would the inconsiderable numbers of the Roman armies have had against the multitudes of the Gauls? Or with what success would their small size have been opposed to the prodigious stature of the Germans? The Spaniards surpassed us not only in numbers, but in physical strength. We were always inferior to the Africans in wealth and unequal to them in deception and stratagem. And the Greeks, indisputably, were far superior to us in skill in arts and all kinds of knowledge.

&gt;But to all these advantages the Romans opposed unusual care in the choice of their levies and in their military training. They thoroughly understood the importance of hardening them by continual practice, and of training them to every maneuver that might happen in the line and in action. Nor were they less strict in punishing idleness and sloth. The courage of a soldier is heightened by his knowledge of his profession, and he only wants an opportunity to execute what he is convinced he has been perfectly taught. A handful of men, inured to war, proceed to certain victory, while on the contrary numerous armies of raw and undisciplined troops are but multitudes of men dragged to slaughter.

I notice the Romans are always seen as invincible and superior their opponents in every way. Like the quote by Livy above, the Romans weren't exactly the perfect army in military abilities, tactics, and strategies. In fact much of the time the Romans were outmatched in many essential areas!Roman Legions were often inferior to their opponents in many essential fields such as quality of weapons,physical conditioning of soldier,numbers, skill of individual warriors, thickness of armor, quality of weapons!For example take armor and weapons. Generally history books make it seem that Romans had the most advanced armor and weaponry in Europe and their opponents often fought with poor armor. But if one researches the enemies the Romans fought, often they had armor and weaponry as heavy as those the Romans had especially some of the more vicious Germanic tribes of the post Pax Romana such as the Visigoths and the Franks!! And the Romans weren't master of tactics and strategies like history books make it out to be. Often when they fought in North Africa and in the Middle East particularly against the Sassanids, the Roman tactical and strategical abilities were significantly inferior to those of their enemies even down right foolish at times. And history books always make the Romans seem like they were masters of siege weaponry and engineering. If one reads , often the siege equipment the Romans used were no better than those of their enemies.

Aside from tactical training, logistics and tenacity in waging wars on strategic level they were average to at most good in many different fields and traits but not the best. Roman Soldiers were less zelous than Jews. They were less physically imposing than Germanic tribes. Roman officers and generals were less brilliant than those of their Greeks. Even their famous resources were matched by their enemies particularly the Sassanids. Carthage, Macedonia, Ptolemaic Egypt, the Seleucid Empire and other Mediterranean powers had comparable technology, social and economic development to the Roman Republic.

In fact whatever tactics,strategies, and equipment the Romans used that were incredibly effective were copied by their enemies!For example Carthage had adopted basic Roman formations and heavy infantry in their armies. When they fought the Romans their equipment was equal to those of the Romans and they used similar formations. The Sassanids were quick to create shock infantry that were heavily armored once they saw the Roman Legions hacked through their regular infantry thus the Sassanids became on par with the Romans in armory and weaponry. Heck Romans armies have time and again been easily defeated by villagers of nations they invaded. Plus their enemies training were as equally grueling as their own! Just research the training of the Sassanid Armies and the . Additionally the Roman Legions even admitted that the Sassanids as skilled as they were in war.

In fact, the Romans themselves admit there were serious deficiencies in their armed forces. Tacitus for instance gives the game away. When the the legions in Germania and Pannonia mutiny upon hearing the death of Augustus, he simply dismisses the causes as being essentially the same as usual.

Why are the Romans always made out to be the most superior army in every in the Classical Age including in weaponry,armor, and strategies and tactics? Practically every big primary source on Roman history from Appian to Tacitus and esp the quoted Livy not only pointed out the weaknesses of the Roman mlitary and enemy superiority in many elements but even write about mutinies in the Legions, backstabbing, desertion in battle, and other stuff about the Roman Army!

1623956549,What’s the story with Augustus preventing Crassus from dedicating the spoila opima to Jupiter?,"I’m reading Adrian Goldsworthy’s *Augustus* and he spends a few paragraphs dismissing the idea that Augustus prevented Marcus Licinius Crassus, the son of the triumvir, from dedicating the *spoila opima* at the temple of Jupiter Feretrius after he killed an enemy king in single combat. 

Apparently Cassus Dio implies that Augustus prevented Crassus from this honor by reading an inscription in the temple by a man named Cossus, but I’m not sure how that is related. The charge is that Augustus used this as a technicality to prevent Crassus from having the honor because he was worried about someone else getting acclaim.

1623948958,Advice on a book,"Hello,

I'm new to ancient history and specifically learning about Ancient Rome; the Mike Duncan podcast sucked me in, and now I'm ready to dig deeper.

I will be reading a physical book; not an audiobook, and not a Kindle. I really like footnotes, references, glossaries, and all that associated supplemental material.

I want to start with the founding; and can't decide between one of the ""easier"" translations of Livy (Warrior, maybe?) or one of the other ancient historians, or maybe even Everitt's ""Rise of Rome"" which seems much easier. I don't want to get too bogged down in difficult texts, but I do want to read good scholarship and get the ""real"" story.

I also want to make sure that whichever book I choose will leave off at a point close to where some other book starts!

I would appreciate any ideas or advice.  Thanks!",ancientrome

1622929147,Tarentum: Its disunity and surrender to Rome,"A rich and powerful city, Tarentum had two political parties, the Democrats and the Aristocrats. They had a strong naval capacity. The other Greek cities admired Tarentum as it proved to be a jewel of a city in the center of the Mediterranean.

But their men preferred the art of trade than of arms and this led them to use mercenaries. The Lucanians above them to would raid their lands and they likewise viewed the Samnites as barbarians. After all, Tarentum is the city of Archytes and of a flourishing trade capital with the highest monarchs of the east. 

What were the Romans doing? Cultivating more weapons, training in the Campus Martius, and attempting to curtail the power of their northern neighbors, the Etruscans. 

The Tarentines were tired and instead of fighting their enemies in the north, they kept asking other powers to help them. The Spartan kings helped them but lost, then Alexander Molossus helped them but was also brutally killed by the Lucanians as Livy and other historians relate. 

In short, the Tarentines, sooner or later, were bound to come in contact with Rome. Once the Lucanians were defeated by Rome, they established trade relations with their new neighbor, wishing to implement a restriction in the gulf of Tarentum so that they can continue implementing their business without foreign competition, after all, they have been around longer.

But they kept squabbling and this enabled Rome to use its influence on the pro-Roman party, the Aristocrats. The population got more divided, several cities in Apulia and Bruttium were helped by Rome, which irritated the Tarentines. When a Roman ship was found in their waters, they attacked it and this provoked the Senate. 

They then sent a diplomat, Postumius, to visit the city and talk things over. As usual, the Tarentines treated the Roman envoy with hostility and Philonides, the party leader, did not do anything when Postumius was mistreated by the Tarentine people in his experience there. 

The Tarentines didn't care if they offended the Romans. They felt themselves safe and secure because they were friends and trading partners with strong leaders. Sparta, Epirus, Corinth, Macedon, etc... 

The Romans knew that to declare a war on a state with a powerful friends would be challenging but they did it anyways. After all, many of the other Greek cities in Magna Graecia did not like the Tarentines and thought that Rome, although Latin, would better serve their interests. 

Tarentum again feels like it can't do this alone and invites Pyrrhus to help them. Just like they invited Sparta, Molossus, Agathocles, etc... except this time, their fate was sealed. 

Rome had the aid of Carthage, of Sicily, and of the various Italic tribes that likewise despised Tarentum. Pyrrhus tried, failed, and abandoned the campaign. 

Tarentum fell and this sent shockwaves across the whole Greek world. Everybody was busy fighting each other, they forgot that things out west were growing and becoming more formidable",ancientrome

I am a newbie just starting out with roman history, and I am looking to expand my understanding. It would be a great help if any of you could suggest any books that cover the general history of Rome , from its founding to its fall. Length doesn't bother me so huge books are fine.
As I have a very basic knowledge I think it would help if any books were of a more foundational level, although I would love some more suggestions of books I can read later on.

1622886672,Father killing a roman emperor?,"Hi!

A few years ago I remember hearing that the role of the father in the family as the ultimate authority was considered so sacred in ancient Roman society that if a father killed his children, that was considered a family affair and the state would not interfere. 

Furthermore, I also heard that this happened to at least one emperor (i.e. the father who was not an emperor killed his son who was an emperor and society was like: ""Well he's the father so he has the right to kill his children if he wants""). I assume this was an exaggerating, but I don't remember exactly where I heard it and have not found it again. Is there any credence to this story at all? Was the role of the father so sacred that he could kill his children and it was considered a family affair that the state would not interfere with? It sounds pretty extreme.",ancientrome

1622845979,Details about the maneuver by Scipio at Ilipa?,"I watched a 2 hours long interesting video on youtube about Scipio’s spanish campaign, When the video comes to Ilipa, it mentions a complex maneuver of roman infantry wings.

In few words, the line of each wing rotated 90 degrees towards the enemy, effectively becoming a column. Then, starting from the point nearest to the enemy, it began to redeploy as a line. This second movement is not described as a rotation again, but more like the movement of single cohortes and manipuli - something like breaking the original column and reforming it in a different way, now with the traditional order of hastati-principes-triarii.

Is anybody familiar with this kind of maneuvers? Could you add some details or links to references? I think I grasped the general sense of the whole thing, but I’m not 100% sure.

Something I did not understand well was the goal of this maneuver: maybe shortening the gap with the enemy line quickly, while leaving them confused?",ancientrome
