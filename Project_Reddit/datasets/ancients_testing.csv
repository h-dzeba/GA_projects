So, are there any greek (or other historic) plays that have happy-is endings? I'm thinking comedies and saytrs *could* fall under this, but I'm not sure (Lysistrata seems to be ok). And I'm tired of reasing about the main character blinding themselves or being cursed!

1641071870,"Drawing Comparisons: Antipater, Regent of the Argeads. The Macedonian Tywin Lannister","Was thinking about it earlier today how Antipater was such a savy player of geopolitics, especially in the years soon after Alexander's death. Ive found him to be a truly under-apprecaited figure in history considering the shrewdness of some of his decisions. These bare a marked similarity (at least in my opinion) to another ""power behind the throne"" type, only this one is a fictitious patriarch in a fantasy series..a little known bit of contemporary culture called game of thrones. The character is the head of House Lannister; Tywin son of Tytos. 

 I was wondering if these two figures could be used as a charcater study of one another, kinda like mirrors of each other especially since I'm working on a dissertation regarding the Hellenistic Period. Some things I noticed:

1) Competerence: Antipater kept Alexander's eastern push going, feeding the army with reinforcements while putting down rebellions among the Spartans and Thracians, much like Tywin did in his early years during the Tarbeck rebellions and his tenure as hand of the king.

2) Political maneuvering: After Alexander died Antipater managed to mostly corner the marriage market of the nobility, securing several important alliances to ensure his position and that of his family - something Tywin also tries to do with his own kids, except Jaime and Cersei have different plans...namely with each other.

3) Daddy issues: They both reject and effectively disinherit their most capable sons (Cassander for Antipater, Tyrion for Tywin) forcing them to make their own way in the world. 

4) Rocky relationships with their Royal Masters: Antipater and Queen Olympias began well enough, even joining forces to make sure Alexander assumed the crown after his father's death, but after competing for influence in Macedon after Alexander went off to conquer the world, they became mortal enemies. Aerys and Tywin also began on a good footing, but as the king went mad he started to get jealous of Tywin. Things went downhill from there.

5) Turbulent begginings / Identity as Reformers: Macedonia was a powder keg of instability before Philip, Antipater, and a slew of other Old guard generals turned it into a functional state. Before them civil wars during periods of succession had been common, as was political assassination. Likewise  House Lannister had become a laughing stock by the time Tywin arrived on the scene; with unruly lords and lands infested with brigandry and crime. His iron fist turned it into one of the most feared and powerful houses in the seven kingdoms, and before that he had fought in the war of the nine penny kings at a relatively young age.

The list was surprising when I thought about it and Antipater is a fascinating figure I wish we knew more about.

I don't know who wrote it, and I don't remember the exact quote, but it went a little something like this:

...a dolphin, plunging like a phallus into the sea...

I haven't been able to find a trace of anything even remotely similar.  Does anybody out there know if there really is a poem or fragment like that in ancient Greek poetry?

The Thracians would become famous for their fighting abilities in foreign armies as mercenaries, often fulfilling the role of skirmishes, excelling at hit and run tactics. Though, in the 6th and early 5th centuries we receive very little detail of their battles. We do hear that they were able to defeat Greek colonists and inflict heavy losses on the Persians during a period that their lands would become a crossroads of campaigning for the Persian empire with their attempts to expand north to Scythia and west towards Macedon and Greece.

1638153906,Lysistrata is the ultimate No-Nut November play.,"I’m being facetious, of course, but what better time of year than now to read (or re-read) Aristophanes’ “Lysistrata”? 

This is a really interesting one to me for several reasons. I’m relatively a novice to Ancient Greek literature and have only recently begun to tackle some of it because of how intimidating it can seem. 

For one, the Lysistrata is obviously extremely dirty, but beyond that, it’s one of the only works of Ancient Greek literature I’ve read that holds up extremely well for today’s audiences without having to know much about the culture, political system, religions, social mores, etc. When I read Homer I often feel like I’m reading about an alien planet, the customs are so odd. That’s enjoyable and informative in a different way, but in my opinion, with the Lysistrata, you can really just jump right in as a novice and (with a few exceptions), the jokes will make plenty of sense even without footnotes. 

29 of the 40 plays Aristophanes wrote are lost to time, which bums me out, but the 11 we do have are fascinating. I’m looking forward to reading more of them.  

Does anyone else feel that way about this particular play? And/or do you have suggestions for other good short works that might be easier for beginners to access?",1,lysistrata be the ultimate november play i m be facetious of course but what well time of year than now to read or aristophanes lysistrata this be a really interest one to me for several reason i m relatively a novice to ancient greek literature and have only recently begin to tackle some of it because of how intimidate it can seem for one the lysistrata be obviously extremely dirty but beyond that it s one of the only work of ancient greek literature i ve read that hold up extremely well for today s audience without have to know much about the culture political system religion social more etc when i read homer i often feel like i m reading about an alien planet the custom be so odd that s enjoyable and informative in a different way but in my opinion with the lysistrata you can really just jump right in a a novice and with a few exception the joke will make plenty of sense even without footnote of the play aristophanes write be lose to time which bum me out but the we do have be fascinate i m look forward to reading more of them does anyone else feel that way about this particular play do you have suggestion for other good short work that might be easy for beginner to access

1638068790,Any Art History buffs who can help a college kid out?,"Hey! 

Writing an essay arguing that some rulers/politicians in Ancient Greece and Rome depicted themselves with references to mythology, as the associated myth (or god) conveyed a value which they wished to be associated with b/c it would benefit them politically. It's for a Classical Art class. 

I have two examples so far:  

1. A [tetradrachm](https://www.slam.org/collection/objects/36557/) depicting Alexander the Great wearing the pelt of the Nymean lion which Heracles traditionally wore. Mostly arguing the association is twofold: Promoting the idea of overwhelming excellence in achievement, as Heracles successfully completed his tasks; AND that Heracles had the rare honor of being deified after death, so Alexander may share this fate because he's so great.
2. The [Augustus of Primaporta](https://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/collezioni/musei/braccio-nuovo/Augusto-di-Prima-Porta.html), which has the following gods/goddesses depicted on the chest piece: Sol (sun) and caelus (sky), tellus (earth goddess), Apollo, Aurora and Diana. I'm arguing that this was done to emphasize the fact that Augustus possessed a connection to the gods, a connection to the past, and martial prowess -- thereby, he was an emperor worthy of respect.

I really need a third example, but can't think of one. Do you guys know of anything that might resemble these two -- a political figure adopting mythology to communicate a message?

Damn I think this greatly damaged and oversimplified the city-state view very badly, meanwhile its glorification is inoffensive it also became associated with nazi scum and such, I noticed how many people constantly is more concerned about demonizing Spartans as baby eaters, rapists, and nazis rather than actually learn more about it, comparisons to other city-states of the time and how it really operated, as someone who loves the greek state this saddens me very much and I feel like people try to say to me that what I like is wrong.",1,the damage effect of movie on the view of sparta for much i have notice the effect of the movie on the view of sparta and how people react to it the movie have several element and topic around message of courage and fight for freedom while show heavy sentiment and downplay the achievement of several other greek state present at the battle the effect be more than prominent such a the state use a symbolism for fascism support or american gun owner and individual of the such damn i think this greatly damage and oversimplify the view very badly meanwhile it glorification be inoffensive it also become associate with nazi scum and such i notice how many people constantly be more concerned about demonize spartans a baby eater rapist and nazi rather than actually learn more about it comparison to other of the time and how it really operate a someone who love the greek state this saddens me very much and i feel like people try to say to me that what i like be wrong

According to Christopher I. Beckwith's analysis of the Aristocles Passage, adiaphora (anatta), astathmēta (dukkha), and anepikrita (anicca) are strikingly similar to the Buddhist three marks of existence,[5] indicating that Pyrrho's teaching is based on Buddhism.

1637430091,About the ritual of Bugonia,"**Bugonia**  was a ritual based on the belief that bees were spontaneously generated  from a cow's carcass, that was killed in order to create new life in  the form of bees :

&gt;Build  a house, ten cubits high, with all the sides of equal dimensions,  with  one door, and four windows, one on each side; put an ox into it,   thirty months old, very fat and fleshy; let a number of young men kill   him by beating him violently with clubs, so as to mangle both flesh and   bones, but taking care not to shed any blood; let all the orifices,   mouth, eyes, nose etc. be stopped up with clean and fine linen,   impregnated with pitch; let a quantity of thyme be strewed under the   reclining animal, and then let windows and doors be closed and covered   with a thick coating of clay, to prevent the access of air or wind.   After three weeks have passed, let the house be opened, and let light   and fresh air get access to it, except from the side from which the wind   blows strongest. Eleven days afterwards, you will find the house full   of bees, hanging together in clusters, and nothing left of the ox but   horns, bones and hair.

*From the Byzantine ""Geoponika"".*

I have a few questions :

1. Why  those two animals specifically, a large ruminant giving birth to small  insects ? Are they ""naturally"" linked to each other, or do the ritual  artificially forces the cow to produce bees ?
2. Did the ancient Greeks believed in other combinations straying from the ""Ox to bees"" original ritual, with other species of animals ?
3. Is there any additional sources on the subject ?

I have a VERY hard time believing this, and I wonder where exactly this came about and why so many people seem to think he was just a lucky general? The only thing lucky about him is how he managed to not die despite being in the front lines constantly, and how an arrow shot him in the chest and could have killed him but he also survived. Yes, Persia was an insanely powerful foe, but I don't think you can so easily dismiss his commanding abilities either. He was able to inspire and motivate his troops with epic speeches, we know of one such epic speech after a conspiracy to mutiny. He was an able fighter himself, constantly in the heat of danger and on the front lines. Among much more.

1636336517,Help with interesting quote from Diodorus,"I was reading Diodorus work and his historical account of the Diadochi and one passage stuck out at me and it was this one: 

“In Asia, after the defeat of Demetrius at Gaza in Syria, Seleucus received from Ptolemy not more than 800 infantry and about 200 cavalry, and set out for Babylon. So high were his expectations that even without any military force at all but accompanied only by his friends and his own slaves he would have undertaken the march into the interior. He reckoned that the Babylonians would readily join his side because of the goodwill they already felt towards him, while Antigonus, by withdrawing his forces a long distance away, had provided him with a suitable opportunity to realise his own ambitions. While he himself was full of eagerness, the friends around him could see that the troops with them were very few in number but that their opponents had large forces available, abundant supplies and a mass of allies, and they were very discouraged. When Seleucus saw their alarm he encouraged them, reminding them that those who had campaigned with Alexander and who had been promoted by him because of their valour should not, when facing adversity, put their trust solely in armed forces and money but in experience and skill, the means by which Alexander himself had achieved his great and universally admired deeds. They should also trust the forecast of the gods, that the end of the expedition would be worthy of his purpose: for when he had consulted the oracle at Branchidae the god had addressed him as King Seleucus, and Alexander himself appearing to him in a dream had given him a clear sign of good and admired among men is achieved by exertion and taking risks. He also courted the favour of his fellow soldiers and dealt with all of them as an equal, which made everyone respect him and be ready to face willingly the perils of the bold venture.” - Diodorus, XIX.90

1635848557,Halloween Mirrors Spooky Beliefs of the Ancient Greeks," Could Halloween, the annual celebration observed in numerous countries across the world on October 31, have ancient Greek roots?

Halloween activities, such as donning spooky costumes, trick or treating, attending costume parties, carving pumpkins, watching scary movies, and visiting pumpkin patches and haunted sites, make the holiday extremely popular amongst the young and the old.

### Halloween likely has roots in Celtic pagan festivals

Yet the celebration is not as secular as it may seem. Also known as All Hallow’s Eve, Halloween has a religious connection. It takes place on the day before the western Christian feast of All Saints’ Day, or All Hallows’ Day. For believers, it is a time to honor and remember the dead, particularly saints and martyrs.

 The many traditions associated with Halloween, however, link it to pagan practices. Most scholars agree that the roots of Halloween and related traditions can be found in pagan Celtic harvest festivals, particularly Samhain.

Likely, these long-held, important traditions and festivals remained even after the Celts were Christianized, and were connected to Christian celebrations.

Much of the Halloween celebrations and traditions that are practiced today were made popular after immigrants from Ireland and Scotland brought them to North America in the 19th century.

Although Halloween itself is linked to Celtic practices, the spooky holiday has many parallels to ancient Greek beliefs as well.

### Ancient Greeks loved spooky tales, like those told on Halloween

  [Debbie Felton](https://www.umass.edu/classics/member/debbie-felton), Professor of Classics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has revealed that “long before Halloween became popular, [ancient Greeks ](https://greekreporter.com/tag/ancient-greeks/)and Romans enjoyed spinning good scary stories about the afterlife, as well as ghosts and monsters.”

In her novel study, entitled “Haunted [Greece](https://greekreporter.com/greece/) and Rome: Ghost Stories from Classical Antiquity,” Felton examined various interesting stories of ghostly spirits and haunting from ancient times, shedding new light on the modern folkloric traditions on the supernatural and[ the monstrous](https://greekreporter.com/2021/09/18/ancient-greek-origins-werewolves/).

“There are many reasons why people enjoy them and enjoy being scared by them. There’s certainly a cathartic effect to hearing a ghost story and being scared out of your wits without ever being in any real danger,” Professor Felton has shared.

Remaining dead serious about the deep connection of Halloween ghosts and monsters with Classical Antiquity’s terrifying narrations, Felton added: “… ghost stories ultimately reflect religious beliefs concerning the importance [of a proper burial](https://greekreporter.com/2021/08/27/greek-funeral-customs-from-ancient-times-to-today/) and the survival of the spirit after death. The dead have a need to rest in peace, while the living have a need to believe in an afterlife…”

 The professor is an editor of the interdisciplinary academic journal [“Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural,” ](https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/preternature/)which is published by [Penn State University Press](http://www.psupress.org/).

According to Felton, monsters and serial killers, either real or fictional, “have been with us since earliest antiquity,” being often “even more horrifying than their modern counterparts,” while she is skeptical about the existence of ghosts.",1,halloween mirrors spooky beliefs of the ancient greeks could halloween the annual celebration observe in numerous country across the world on october have ancient greek root halloween activity such a don spooky costume trick or treat attend costume party carve pumpkin watch scary movie and visit pumpkin patch and haunt site make the holiday extremely popular amongst the young and the old halloween likely have root in celtic pagan festival yet the celebration be not a secular a it may seem also know a all hallow s eve halloween have a religious connection it take place on the day before the western christian feast of all saints day or all hallows day for believer it be a time to honor and remember the dead particularly saint and martyr the many tradition associate with halloween however link it to pagan practice most scholar agree that the root of halloween and related tradition can be found in pagan celtic harvest festival particularly samhain likely these important tradition and festival remain even after the celts be christianized and be connect to christian celebration much of the halloween celebration and tradition that be practice today be make popular after immigrant from ireland and scotland brought them to north america in the century although halloween itself be link to celtic practice the spooky holiday have many parallel to ancient greek belief a well ancient greeks love spooky tale like those told on halloween debbie felton professor of classics at the university of massachusetts amherst have reveal that long before halloween become popular ancient greeks romans enjoy spin good scary story about the afterlife a well a ghost and in her novel study entitle haunted greece and rome ghost stories from classical antiquity felton examine various interest story of ghostly spirit and haunt from ancient time shed new light on the modern folkloric tradition on the supernatural and the monstrous there be many reason why people enjoy them and enjoy be scar by them there s certainly a cathartic effect to hearing a ghost story and be scar out of your wit without ever be in any real danger professor felton have share remaining dead serious about the deep connection of halloween ghost and monster with classical antiquity s terrify narration felton add ghost story ultimately reflect religious belief concern the importance of a proper burial and the survival of the spirit after death the dead have a need to rest in peace while the living have a need to believe in an the professor be an editor of the interdisciplinary academic journal preternature critical and historical studies on the preternatural be publish by penn state university press according to felton monster and serial killer either real or fictional have be with u since early antiquity be often even more horrify than their modern counterpart while she be skeptical about the existence of ghost

1635675804,Went to the Acropolis yesterday but was disappointed because I did not have a guide. Should I go back with a guide?,"I have a big fascination for philosophy and the Ancient Greek culture. So for my trip to Athens I really wanted to learn more about it's rich history with context. I thought solo-ing the Acropolis and it's museum at my pace would do that, but it has left me feeling disappointed. Mostly because I am not learning or feel like I am engaged with the history in front of me as I would like to. I would occasionally hear guides for other groups and thought that that was exactly what would help,  


I am here for 2 more days, do you think going back to the acropolis with a guide would be worthwhile, or should I cut my losses and do a guide for a different activity. (I also like nature if you think I should just double down and connect with my inner self / natural world of Greece)

1635264984,A Griffin Warrior: A Staggering Discovery from Ancient Greece," 

The discovery of the Griffin Warrior Tomb is one of the most fascinating archaeological findings as it seems to link the Minoan and the Mycenaean civilisations.

On May 28, 2015, the archaeologists excavating in Pylos, southwestern Greece, discovered a Bronze Age tomb with a skeleton surrounded by rich artefacts, suggesting it belonged to an important man.

The grave belongs to the Mycenaean Civilisation, approximately 1750 BC-1050 BC. Also, many of the objects found seem to be related to the Minoan Civilisation, c. 3500 BC – 1100 BC.

 

Overall archaeological research has shown that the Mycenaean had reached most of the eastern Mediterranean, including ancient Egypt, the city-states of the Near East (today’s Turkey), and the islands of the Mediterranean.

However, the strongest connection discovered is the one with the Minoan Civilisation in the island of Crete.

The Minoan Civilisation was named after the legendary King Minos, but the islanders’ culture was very different from that found on mainland Greece.",1,a griffin warrior a staggering discovery from ancient greece the discovery of the griffin warrior tomb be one of the most fascinate archaeological finding a it seem to link the minoan and the mycenaean civilisation on may the archaeologist excavate in pylos southwestern greece discover a bronze age tomb with a skeleton surround by rich artefact suggest it belong to an important man the grave belongs to the mycenaean civilisation approximately bc also many of the object found seem to be related to the minoan civilisation bc bc overall archaeological research have show that the mycenaean have reach most of the eastern mediterranean include ancient egypt the of the near east today s turkey and the island of the mediterranean however the strong connection discover be the one with the minoan civilisation in the island of crete the minoan civilisation be name after the legendary king minos but the islander culture be very different from that found on mainland greece

1634276145,"Byzantines: Greeks, Romans, or Greeks cosplaying as Romans?","So this is a controversial topic, especially among Roman history enthusiasts (less among Roman history *scholars*), but I want the opinions of some of you Hellenophiles. Obviously this goes beyond the ~400CE (which is a strange date for setting the end of the Ancient era IMO) time frame, so apologies for that. 

Anyway, I am of the opinion the ""Romans"" beyond their Crisis of the Third Century began to become less and less ""Roman"" and more and more Greek over the next few centuries. It wasn't just some ""Rome ended in 224CE"" or anything so simple as that, but the Romans were 97% Roman when Septimius Severus took control, were 80% Roman by Diocletian (and like 18% Greek), and these numbers just swapped over the coming centuries. Justinian and Belisarius are often considered the ""last"" Romans, and I think this is probably a pretty good point to consider the Eastern Roman Empire becoming majority Greek. Of language, culture, architecture, religion, foodstuffs, naming, pretty much all of it. By the death of Justinian they were say 52% Greek and 35% Roman and the rest mixed Germanic, Syriac, maybe tiny bits Celtic, etc etc. 

Obviously they are almost nothing like the Archaic or Classical Hellenes. We can call them Hellenes 4.0 (Mycenaeans being 1.0, Archaic/Classical 2.0, Hellenistic in Egypt, Bactria, India, Syria, along the Euxine being 3.0). But they seem as distinct from the Romans of Camillus, Africanus, Caesar or Trajan as the Greeks were. This is why we call them the Byzantines, not simply for the ease of distinguishing them from the WRE or the Holy Roman Empire or Rum. 

I believe we should come up with a new term for these people, to highlight the fact they were mostly Greeks, or peoples that had mixed with some Greeks, or Hellenized to some degree. Helleno-Roman perhaps. Every time I have brought this up among Roman-enthusiast, the Roman fanboys basically just insult me to the point of drowning out any discussion, because they **so want** the Romans to continue to 1453. This seems much too simplistic to me. 

Anyway, I would be very interested in hearing some Hellenophiles thoughts on the Byzantines, how ""Roman"" they were, if others view them similarly to myself as primarily Greek, but heavily influenced by Italian...well everything.",1,byzantines greeks romans or greeks cosplaying a romans so this be a controversial topic especially among roman history enthusiast less among roman history scholar but i want the opinion of some of you hellenophiles obviously this go beyond the which be a strange date for set the end of the ancient era imo time frame so apology for that anyway i be of the opinion the romans beyond their crisis of the third century begin to become less and less roman and more and more greek over the next few century it be just some rome end in or anything so simple a that but the romans be roman when septimius severus take control be roman by diocletian and like greek and these number just swap over the come century justinian and belisarius be often consider the last romans and i think this be probably a pretty good point to consider the eastern roman empire become majority greek of language culture architecture religion foodstuff name pretty much all of it by the death of justinian they be say greek and roman and the rest mixed germanic syriac maybe tiny bit celtic etc etc obviously they be almost nothing like the archaic or classical hellenes we can call them hellenes mycenaeans be hellenistic in egypt bactria india syria along the euxine be but they seem a distinct from the romans of camillus africanus caesar or trajan a the greeks be this be why we call them the byzantines not simply for the ease of distinguish them from the wre or the holy roman empire or rum i believe we should come up with a new term for these people to highlight the fact they be mostly greeks or people that have mixed with some greeks or hellenized to some degree perhaps every time i have brought this up among the roman fanboys basically just insult me to the point of drown out any discussion because they so want the romans to continue to this seem much too simplistic to me anyway i would be very interested in hearing some hellenophiles thought on the byzantines how roman they be if others view them similarly to myself a primarily greek but heavily influence by italian well everything

1633804068,Were helots of Sparta pre Indo European people subjugated by Indo-European invaders?,"&gt;I asked this at r/askhistorians and nobody answered.


The Helots of Sparta were by all accounts treated miserably by the Spartans who are considered or believed be a group of Indo Europeans who migrated to the Greece mainland.

The treatment of Helots sound an awful like how Indo-Europeans in India treated thier subjugated people. In fact it even sounds like a caste system. Assigning them to lower castes and just generally treating them miserably. We often hear about how the Indo Europeans were a small group of invader who ruled larger local populations. Well this sounds exactly like that.

So were the Helots people in a similar situation?

I've heard Helots being described as everything from a slaves from foreign lands to neighbouring city states conquered by the Spartans. But none of the explanations make sense. But the subjugation of people and forcing them into the lower castes of society makes more sense. I mean Doric Spartans were believed to be Indo European and these people set up similar systems in India. So it wouldn't be a stretch to thing that Helots were simply pre Indo Europeans who were under foreign rule. 


It even explains the Peloponnesian war and the lack of political unity of Greece in classical era. The Achaeian Delian league being places with more pre Indo European cultures or people while the Spartans led Peloponnesian League being more Indo European. It would explain why so historical writers said that they could tell Dorics and Achaeian apart.

Who minted it?,"I have been looking at Cumae, which is assumed to be one of the first sites of Greek colonization (I'm counting Pithekussai as a trading post), but this coin confuses me. You see, my understanding is that Cumae was taken from the Greeks by Oscans and Samnites in 421 BCE, but did not fall under Roman rule until 338 BCE. 

So, what was going on when this coin was minted? Who minted it? I'm still learning about Greek history, but it seems that--since this is a didrachm--it must be a Greek coin.

Sorry if this is an obvious answer, but I've searched online and can't find any info on what Cumae was like in this period.

1632437187,Cyrus the Moses,"Xenophon Cyropedia 1.2.2
&gt;*Cyrus* was educated in conformity with the laws of the Persians; and these laws appear in their care for the common weal not to start from the same point as they do in most states. For most states permit every one to train his own children just as he will, and the older people themselves to live as they please; and then they command them **not to steal and not to rob**, not to break into anybody's house, not to strike a person whom they have no right to strike, **not to commit adultery**, not to disobey an officer, and so forth; and if a man transgress anyone one of these laws, they punish him.
 
Xenophon, Cyropaedia 1.3 *Child prodigy aged 12*
&gt; Cyrus received until he was *twelve years old* or a little more; and he showed himself superior to all the other boys of his age both in mastering his tasks quickly and in doing everything in a thorough and manly fashion  

&gt; Luke 2:42 when he was twelve years

In the Cyropedia, King Cyrus was a child prodigy and educated in Laws that includes **not to steal, not to commit adultery** and it describes breaking them as a **transgression**

The verb transgress in Xenophon is **παραβαίνω** and the Hebrew translation is **העביר**

&gt;Deuteronomy 26:13
לא עברתי ממצותיך 

&gt;οὐ παραβέβηκα τά θέσμια σου ""I have not transgressed thy laws""

The verb עברתי could also be ἁμαρτάνω.  So the language here in the Torah and Xenophon are very much the same.

Numbers 8:7 לחטאת / τῇ καθάρσει
  ""for cleansing from guilt""

&gt;&gt; Homer's Odyssey 3.446
Then the old man, Nestor, driver of chariots, began the opening rite of hand-washing and sprinkling with barley grains, and earnestly he prayed to Athena, cutting off as first offering the hair from the head, and casting it into the fire.


&gt;&gt;Electra 90
I wept and cut off a lock of my hair as an offering and sacrificed over the altar the blood of a slaughtered sheep

&gt;&gt; Numbers 6:18 — The Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.

So the rituals of the Torah are not unique to Jews, this also includes Matsza, barley cake eaten by Spartans hence eaten as a reminder of slavery.

&gt;&gt;Aeschylus Agamemnon 1035
Once endured to be sold and to eat the bread of slavery **(μάζης)**

&gt;&gt; Genesis 19:3

1628218239,"TALES OF gods, ART and NFT","🔱Greek mythology is filled with epic tales of adventure, from Achilles, Hercules to the story of Jason and the Argonauts, they all portray the tales of gods, goddesses, wits, and heroism. Even Hollywood can’t stop making movies out of greek mythologies and one that fascinates me is the story of Odysseus, king of an ancient greek kingdom known as Ithaca.  It was 1997 and everyone was talking about the adventure of Odysseus, Jim was my childhood buddy, a fast-talker, his fast-talking nature earned him the nickname “the comedian”, sometimes I call him Chris talker (replacing tucker with talker), lol. So there I was listening to Jim as he talked about the story of Odysseus, he was raw, unedited and that made me want to see the movie myself. Fast forward to a couple of days later, I got myself the movie, and yea, it was epic. I fell in love with Greek myths instantly, all thanks to the goddess Calypso, played by Vanessa Williams. She was alluring, Posidsein’s wrath gave me the chills and why you should not mess with the gods. Odysseus' tales explored almost all the world of the Greek myths, delivering a whole new experience of adventure 

🔱Homer was the author of Odyssey, which is the tale of Odysseus and the Iliad, both of which became the foundational works of Greek literature. Homer’s tale from Iliad believed that Oceanus and his consort Tethys, the titan's daughter of Uranus and Gaia created all living things, including the gods of Olympus

🔱Greek tales blew me into the world of arts, the gods were known to be an embodiment of perfect chiseled physiology and beauty, used by some artists as a reference to bring their creativity to life. The idea of life and invisible forces, challenged the creative skills of artists in the Greco-Roman world, which is the central point to the development of art in the Western world. I started taking some art classes from Proko. Quite challenging but every inch of my practice drew me closer to achieving my dream of becoming an artist focused on the genre that I have come to admire, which is Greek mythology.

🔱As the years went by, I became better and the quest to transform my art into liquid cash was relevant. And so came the rise of NFTs but the emergence of various platforms made it a challenge of picking one tailored to fit my needs. It wasn’t long before I came in contact with THEOS (The Hyper Economy Operating System). The striking part of this project is the artistic beauty of their user interface and story that is inspired by Greek mythology.

🔱THEOS is the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) paradise of NFTs that guarantees instant liquidity for both fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This is precisely what I need, it’s going to be an NFT marketplace and will be automated to fit the dynamic nature of prices that we see in the NFT niche. The project aims to bring real-world assets into the blockchain industry with a proper incentive ecosystem. Oh yea I forgot, they have something called the “ODYSSEY POOL”, which brings back memories and has a wide use cases

🔱NFTs have revolutionized cryptocurrency in a very short period and with THEOS, your data which could be art, virtual goods for games, etc can easily be turned into liquid intellectual property. The concept brought forth by THEOS is a good one, bringing in new life to the blockchain industry while lighting up the sky in a glorious way, just like the lightning bolt of Zeus.",1,tales of god art and nft mythology be fill with epic tale of adventure from achilles hercules to the story of jason and the argonauts they all portray the tale of god goddess wit and heroism even hollywood can t stop make movie out of greek mythology and one that fascinates me be the story of odysseus king of an ancient greek kingdom know a ithaca it be and everyone be talk about the adventure of odysseus jim be my childhood buddy a his nature earn him the nickname the comedian sometimes i call him chris talker replace tucker with talker lol so there i be listen to jim a he talk about the story of odysseus he be raw unedited and that make me want to see the movie myself fast forward to a couple of day later i get myself the movie and yea it be epic i fell in love with greek myth instantly all thanks to the goddess calypso played by vanessa williams she be allure posidsein s wrath give me the chill and why you should not mess with the god odysseus tale explore almost all the world of the greek myth deliver a whole new experience of adventure be the author of odyssey which be the tale of odysseus and the iliad both of which become the foundational work of greek literature homer s tale from iliad believe that oceanus and his consort tethys the titan daughter of uranus and gaia create all living thing include the god of olympus tale blew me into the world of art the god be know to be an embodiment of perfect chisel physiology and beauty use by some artist a a reference to bring their creativity to life the idea of life and invisible force challenged the creative skill of artist in the world which be the central point to the development of art in the western world i start take some art class from proko quite challenge but every inch of my practice drew me closer to achieve my dream of become an artist focus on the genre that i have come to admire which be greek mythology the year go by i become well and the quest to transform my art into liquid cash be relevant and so come the rise of nfts but the emergence of various platform make it a challenge of pick one tailor to fit my need it wasn t long before i come in contact with theos the hyper economy operating system the strike part of this project be the artistic beauty of their user interface and story that be inspire by greek mythology be the defi decentralized finance paradise of nfts that guarantee instant liquidity for both fungible and token nfts this be precisely what i need it s go to be an nft marketplace and will be automate to fit the dynamic nature of price that we see in the nft niche the project aim to bring asset into the blockchain industry with a proper incentive ecosystem oh yea i forgot they have something call the odyssey pool which brings back memory and have a wide use case have revolutionize cryptocurrency in a very short period and with theos your data which could be art virtual good for game etc can easily be turn into liquid intellectual property the concept brought forth by theos be a good one bring in new life to the blockchain industry while light up the sky in a glorious way just like the lightning bolt of zeus

[The Greek and Persian Wars](https://preview.redd.it/2rp8xmmombe71.jpg?width=270&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95c9f3b033f5eac3bc1f5c5c4546f836553a7eee)

The Greek and Persian wars would be a defining moment in the Greek world helping shape the trajectory of development in Greece and around the Aegean for time to come. Even today a detailed ancient account survives describing the events of 2500 years in what is one of the oldest works of history. Herodotus who has been labelled the father of history would be born during the wars and would travel the Greek world later in life collecting all he could, so as to understand what brought the Greeks and Persian to make war.

In this episode we will be looking back at the last 18 episodes that looked at the Greco-Persian Wars and try and tie everything together, so as to refresh ourselves on all that has taken place over the 21 years since the Ionian revolt. This will then put us in a good position to then move on with the narrative of the series.

The Greek and Persian Wars are often seen as beginning with the decision by Athens and Eretria to send ships to aide the Ionian revolt. Herodotus would say; “These ships were the beginnings of evil for both Hellenes and Barbarians”. The revolt would ultimately fail and Persian attention would now be focused on Greece.

Two main invasions would be launched that would directly attack Greece, these coming in 490 BC and 48 BC. In these two invasions we see some of the most well know battles take place such as Marathon, Thermopylae and Salamis. Though some lesser known would also be fought, but just as, if not more important battles, Plataea, Mycale and Artemisium.

The Greeks would end up defeating the Persian invasions but this wouldn’t see the end of operations. The Persian threat still loomed large in their minds and measures were taken to strengthen themselves against any further invasions. This as we move forward in the series would have consequences shaping politics and relations as the years past.",1,new episode the wars episode the wars the greek and persian wars the greek and persian war would be a define moment in the greek world help shape the trajectory of development in greece and around the aegean for time to come even today a detailed ancient account survives describe the event of year in what be one of the old work of history herodotus who have be label the father of history would be born during the war and would travel the greek world later in life collect all he could so a to understand what brought the greeks and persian to make war in this episode we will be look back at the last episode that look at the wars and try and tie everything together so a to refresh ourselves on all that have take place over the year since the ionian revolt this will then put u in a good position to then move on with the narrative of the series the greek and persian wars be often see a begin with the decision by athens and eretria to send ship to aide the ionian revolt herodotus would say these ship be the beginning of evil for both hellenes and barbarians the revolt would ultimately fail and persian attention would now be focus on greece two main invasion would be launch that would directly attack greece these come in bc and bc in these two invasion we see some of the most well know battle take place such a marathon thermopylae and salamis though some lesser know would also be fought but just a if not more important battle plataea mycale and artemisium the greeks would end up defeat the persian invasion but this wouldn t see the end of operation the persian threat still loom large in their mind and measure be take to strengthen themselves against any far invasion this a we move forward in the series would have consequence shape politics and relation a the year past

1626716554,A sophist walks into the Ecclesia....,"Herodotus, Book X: 

A sophist impious orator was preaching in the Ecclesia on Socrates, a known advocate of the Thirty Tyrants.

“Before my speech begins, you must get on your knees and praise Apollo for the Spartan constitution and accept that they were the most highly-evolved laws that Hellas has ever known, even greater than Athenian Democracy!”

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, Athenian champion who had served 30 summers sailing across the Aegean and understood the necessity of protecting the Laws and fully supported all military decision made by the Athenian demos stood up and held up a parchment.

“How old are these laws, Sophist?”

The arrogant philosopher smirked quite sardonically and smugly replied, “Merely a hundred years as they were invented by that rabblerouser Pericles who was inspired by Lycurgus.”

“Wrong. It’s been 220 years since Draco created them. If it was only a mere century years old and Lycurgus, as you say, inspired them... then the Ionian poleis would not be democratic as they are today.”

The Orator was visibly shaken, and dropped his copy of the Republic. He stormed out of the Ecclesia crying those sophist crocodile tears. The same tears oligarchists cry for the “nobles” (who today live in such luxury that most own at least 500 slaves) when they jealously try to claw and cut the wages of fleet-rowers and jurymen. There is no doubt that at this point our Philo““““““sopher”””””, Xenocrates, wished he had pulled himself up by his sandalstraps and become more than a sophist oligarchist orator. He wished so much that he had hemlock to poison himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!

The Athenian citizens applauded and held vote for the new elections of the Strategos that day and accepted Athenian democracy as their lord and savior. An owl named “Solon” flew into the room and perched atop the pillar where the laws were written and shed a tear on the wax. The laws were read several times, and Athena herself showed up and enacted the planning for the construction 100 triremes.

The sophist lost his citizenship and was ostracized the next day. He died of the plague sent to him by Apollo and was tossed into the river Styx for all eternity.",1,a sophist walk into the ecclesia herodotus book x a sophist impious orator be preach in the ecclesia on socrates a know advocate of the thirty tyrants before my speech begin you must get on your knee and praise apollo for the spartan constitution and accept that they be the most law that hellas have ever know even great than athenian democracy at this moment a brave patriotic athenian champion who have serve summer sail across the aegean and understood the necessity of protect the laws and fully support all military decision make by the athenian demo stood up and held up a parchment how old be these law sophist the arrogant philosopher smirk quite sardonically and smugly reply merely a hundred year a they be invent by that rabblerouser pericles who be inspire by wrong it s be year since draco create them if it be only a mere century year old and lycurgus a you say inspire them then the ionian poleis would not be democratic a they be the orator be visibly shaken and drop his copy of the republic he storm out of the ecclesia cry those sophist crocodile tear the same tear oligarchists cry for the noble who today live in such luxury that most own at least slave when they jealously try to claw and cut the wage of and juryman there be no doubt that at this point our philo sopher xenocrates wish he have pull himself up by his sandalstraps and become more than a sophist oligarchist orator he wish so much that he have hemlock to poison himself from embarrassment but he himself have petition against them the athenian citizen applaud and held vote for the new election of the strategos that day and accepted athenian democracy a their lord and savior an owl name solon flew into the room and perch atop the pillar where the law be write and shed a tear on the wax the law be read several time and athena herself show up and enact the planning for the construction trireme the sophist lose his citizenship and be ostracize the next day he die of the plague sent to him by apollo and be toss into the river styx for all eternity

![img](ldf3nrimf5971 "" 'They are breaking, Nik!' he heard Hermogenes' exhausted shout on the left.
'Dress the line! Dress the line now!' Nikephoros bellowed over the deafening roar of battle.  He ripped his dory out of the shapeless heap of fallen bodies on the ground. It took all his remaining strength to just stand straight. Holding the aspis high enough to cover his chest suddenly seemed an impossible task.
The chaos was overwhelming. Dust covered everything, foes attacked from every angle. He managed to lift the shield on his shoulder, just in time to push back a pair of Sakai trying to cut him off from the phalanx. Two quick flashes flew around his helmet, first right, then left, and he felt, more than saw, his rear-ranker Bias quickly dispatching the two enemies.
'You owe me one,' he heard his friend's voice, even as he half-dragged him back into the line.
'More than I can count now...'
Suddenly, a great shout came from the far right: 'On my command. Two steps back!'
Somehow, Themistocles still held enough breath to make himself heard over the mad cacophony. And such was the power of his voice that the front lines started to form up, dragging their injured back, the epistatai hastily replacing fallen comrades in the first rank.
'Two steps back - and not a step more!' shouted  the strategos. 'Now!'
Nikephoros stepped closer to his friends, locking shields with Chalcon on his right and Hermogenes on the left. Behind him, he felt Bias' aspis. Courage surged back into the phalanx.
'Two more steps, lads. Nobody breaks!'
Together, the center of the line fell back, then again, locking together, reforming.
'Nobody runs! This is our land, Leontis! We shall not give it to them!'

It consists of 64 vellum pages of Middle English written in rhyming couplets. In this, it differs from the prose of all the later charges. The poem begins by describing how Euclid ""counterfeited geometry"" and called it masonry, for the employment of the children of the nobility in Ancient Egypt. It then recounts the spread of the art of geometry in ""divers lands."" The document relates how the craft of masonry was brought to England during the reign of King Athelstan (924–939)

1619633651,Song in the style of Ancient Greek music with Ancient Greek lyrics.,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovj9swmP2ZY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovj9swmP2ZY)

Hey everyone! I'm interested in ethnomusicology, and this is a song I composed following my research into Ancient Greek music--I took a poem by Callimachus (the poem is called Callimachus 2), and gave myself the goal of putting the words into a song that is as historically accurate as possible. Our understanding of Ancient Greek music is limited, but developed enough that we can have a generally accurate reconstruction.

The poem is by Callimachus (Καλλίμαχος) , c. 310/305–c. 240 BC, who was one of the most influential poets of the Hellenistic Age. He was also a librarian at the Library of Alexandria. This poem I used was dedicated to his friend, Heraclitus of Halicarnassus, another poet of the time. Hellenistic literature and poetry was in part defined by an interest in more everyday and mundane subjects, in contrast to prior eras' interest in great historical and mythological events. This poem is a good example of that--it's about Callimachus mourning the death of his friend.

I did my best to pronounce this as accurately as possible when singing--I employed reconstructed, Hellenistic era Koine pronunciation. I based the pronunciation mainly on Ioannis Stratakis' reading of the poem--he's a long time specialist in reading Ancient Greek texts. 

For the music, I used a reconstruction of the Kithara, that harp like instrument you've likely seen in many vases and visual representations. I then used a basic frame drum like those used in Ancient Greece, and cymbals, which were also used at the time. The melody uses musical modes that were in use back in the days of Ancient Greece, namely what we would today call the Double Harmonic Major and Aeolian modes. 

Something important to note is that Ancient Greeks linked emotions to certain scales--Aristotle in the *Politics* explains how certain *harmoniai* (musical moods) are tied to certain emotional states, and explains how the Phrygian musical mode was seen as full of excitement and adventure, or how the Dorian mode was seen as reflective and meditative. Therefore, following this idea, I decided to link the poem's emotional mood to musical modes that reflect the words. 

This is an important distinction to make with many types of music throughout the world. Middle-Eastern music, for example, is for the most part uninterested in ideas of mood or emotion--the melodies aren't necessarily meant to evoke feelings. Ancient Greek music, however, was all about pathos and the emotional state, thus why I used the Double Harmonic Major for the part of the poem that is very distraught, and the Aeolian for the part that is more sad, since it seems that the Greeks indeed chose certain musical modes for certain emotional moods. 

Another thing to note is the debate on whether Ancient Greek music was monophonic (all the instruments play the same melody without variation) or if there was harmony (the combination of one or two more notes) and polyphony (two or more independent melodies played at the same time). There's still debate on that; most academics seem to believe that Ancient Greek music was largely monophonic and based around simple melodies, but there's reason to believe that basic forms of harmony and polyphony did exist back then. (Plato, in ""Laws"", Book VII, Section 812d, advises learning musicians to simply play the exact same melody that their teacher plays in order to avoid the ""florid use of harmony,"" which means Greeks of the 5th century B.C did use the musical concept). 

Therefore, I played the first part of the song in a monophonic way: I sang a melody and played the exact same melody on the Kithara. The second part of the song gives us an idea of what harmonic Ancient Greek music would have been like: I added independent melodies alongside the main melody in order to ornament it. Keep in mind that this second version, the ornamented one with harmony and polyphony, is the more controversial one, and most academicians would generally prefer the former, simpler monophonic form of the song as the more historically accurate one.

All in all, this isn't going to be an exact replica of how Greek music from the Hellenistic Age would have sounded--it's impossible to get it exactly right since our knowledge of the era's music is limited, but this should be a generally accurate if imperfect attempt at capturing the sound of Ancient Greece :)",1,song in the style of ancient greek music with ancient greek lyric hey everyone i interested in ethnomusicology and this be a song i compose follow my research into ancient greek music i take a poem by callimachus the poem be call callimachus and give myself the goal of put the word into a song that be a historically accurate a possible our understand of ancient greek music be limited but developed enough that we can have a generally accurate reconstruction the poem be by callimachus καλλίμαχος bc who be one of the most influential poet of the hellenistic age he be also a librarian at the library of alexandria this poem i use be dedicate to his friend heraclitus of halicarnassus another poet of the time hellenistic literature and poetry be in part define by an interest in more everyday and mundane subject in contrast to prior era interest in great historical and mythological event this poem be a good example of that it about callimachus mourn the death of his friend i do my best to pronounce this a accurately a possible when sing i employ reconstruct hellenistic era koine pronunciation i base the pronunciation mainly on ioannis stratakis reading of the poem he a long time specialist in reading ancient greek text for the music i use a reconstruction of the kithara that harp like instrument you likely see in many vas and visual representation i then use a basic frame drum like those use in ancient greece and cymbal which be also use at the time the melody us musical mode that be in use back in the day of ancient greece namely what we would today call the double harmonic major and aeolian mode something important to note be that ancient greeks link emotion to certain scale aristotle in the politics explains how certain harmoniai musical mood be tie to certain emotional state and explains how the phrygian musical mode be see a full of excitement and adventure or how the dorian mode be see a reflective and meditative therefore follow this idea i decide to link the poem emotional mood to musical mode that reflect the word this be an important distinction to make with many type of music throughout the world music for example be for the most part uninterested in idea of mood or emotion the melody be necessarily meant to evoke feeling ancient greek music however be all about pathos and the emotional state thus why i use the double harmonic major for the part of the poem that be very distraught and the aeolian for the part that be more sad since it seem that the greeks indeed chose certain musical mode for certain emotional mood another thing to note be the debate on whether ancient greek music be monophonic all the instrument play the same melody without variation or if there be harmony the combination of one or two more note and polyphony two or more independent melody played at the same time there still debate on that most academic seem to believe that ancient greek music be largely monophonic and base around simple melody but there reason to believe that basic form of harmony and polyphony do exist back then plato in laws book vii section advises learn musician to simply play the exact same melody that their teacher play in order to avoid the florid use of harmony which mean greeks of the century do use the musical concept therefore i played the first part of the song in a monophonic way i sang a melody and played the exact same melody on the kithara the second part of the song give u an idea of what harmonic ancient greek music would have be like i add independent melody alongside the main melody in order to ornament it keep in mind that this second version the ornament one with harmony and polyphony be the more controversial one and most academician would generally prefer the former simpler monophonic form of the song a the more historically accurate one all in all this be go to be an exact replica of how greek music from the hellenistic age would have sound it impossible to get it exactly right since our knowledge of the era music be limited but this should be a generally accurate if imperfect attempt at capture the sound of ancient greece
1619614288,"Rotunda of Galerius, Thessaloniki/GREECE"," 

The oldest monument in Thessaloniki, the **Rotunda** (also known as **Agios Georgios**) is a massive round building that was first a Roman mausoleum, then a Christian church, then a mosque. Its interior is decorated with Early Christian mosaics; outside is the city’s only surviving minaret.

The Rotunda was built by the Roman emperor Galerius (**305-11**) as part of a large palace complex in Thessaloniki. It was probably intended to be his mausoleum, but it was never used as such. The Rotunda of Galerius was converted into a Christian church in the late 4th century or mid-5th century. The **date** of conversion to a church has been difficult to determine with any certainty. There is no written documentation about the event, so dating has to be based on analysis of the style of the mosaics and the historical situation of Thessaloniki in these early centuries. 

hessaloniki flourished, and developed at a fast pace into the mid-6th century.

In the assembly of the municipality (ecclesia), where he initially tried to speak twice, he did not succeed, because he was hindered by his nervousness and the difficulty in pronouncing ""L"" and ""R"". This humiliation hurt him, but he did not give up.

Demosthenes the stutterer, as his stepmother used to call him, with his faith and perseverance, going daily to Faliro (a local beach) and reading difficult texts with his mouth full of pebbles accompanied by the sound of the waves, managed to face his  disability and the nervousness caused by this weakness.

1618609946,"Looking for info about the female ""Prophêta"" of Apollo temple of Didyma","Apperently ""prophêta"" was a type of shaman (maybe not exactly shaman, but definitely someone of relatively low prestige than an actual prophet). The prophêta of the Apollo temple in Didyma (present day Didim, Southwestern Turkey), for example, was an illiterate, half-mad woman. She was probably using some substances and entered a state of trance, voicing the messages of the god Apollo.

1618439838,Why do all historical fiction novels set during the Trojan War always tread the same ground?,"It seems to me that most historical fiction, books but also media, regarding the Trojan War alway either try to retell or subvert the same portions of the Trojan War myth that everyone knows.  And frankly, as someone who has read most of not all the original material, it comes off as nowhere near as entertaining as the original source material.  They always make the Trojan War seem smaller in scale than the original poems did, and authors usually rush to the major points that have already been expertly told by superior poets and authors from another time.
I guess my big question is, have any authors attempted to focus their stories on sections of the story or myth that are known but the original material is lost?  For example the Aethiopis, little Iliad, etc.?  I always thought there’s a ton of potentially great characters and arcs that you’d think an author would love having the freedom to explore and tell stories in, without being worried their work would be compared to their ancient, titanic counterparts.  Like, Memnon, Neoptolemus or Palamedes.",1,why do all historical fiction novel set during the trojan war always tread the same ground it seem to me that most historical fiction book but also medium regard the trojan war alway either try to retell or subvert the same portion of the trojan war myth that everyone know and frankly a someone who have read most of not all the original material it come off a nowhere near a entertain a the original source material they always make the trojan war seem small in scale than the original poem do and author usually rush to the major point that have already be expertly told by superior poet and author from another time i guess my big question be have any author attempt to focus their story on section of the story or myth that be know but the original material be lose for example the aethiopis little iliad i always thought there s a ton of potentially great character and arc that you d think an author would love have the freedom to explore and tell story in without be worried their work would be compare to their ancient titanic counterpart like memnon neoptolemus or palamedes

1615776764,Books/other resources to help a kid learn (5th/6th grade) learn about Ancient Greece?,"Hi there! I hope I'm in the right sub for this. 

My mother has been homeschooling my eleven-year-old sister for about a year. Long story, but she essentially just shows her documentaries (a lot of woo-woo Ancient Aliens stuff :/) and occasionally has her do workbooks. I am trying to teach her some history and literature so that if/when she does go back to school she isn't completely lost. 

I asked my sister where she wanted to begin, and she told me she was interested in Ancient Greece. So here I am. 

I am not a teacher and have no idea where to start. I also work full time and don't have as much time/energy as I'd like to research and create a good curriculum. Does anyone happen to know of any age-appropriate, accessible-to-young-readers resources on Ancient/Classical Greece? Or at least a good place to start looking for them?

My sister has read D'Aulaire's but has no other knowledge on the topic. I've spent some time on YouTube/History.com/Wikipedia/Amazon (for books) so far.

The verses speak of epic romance, sheer cunning, and tragic consequences.

While some have argued that Troy was a myth, others believe in the existence of the city. So is Troy more than just a tale? If it is, where does it exist today? And what led to its’ destruction?

My name is Maxim and I've been a longtime classics student and lover of ancient languages. I've taken eight years of Latin, five years of Ancient Greek (Homeric and Attic), and one year of Ancient Egyptian. I'm also a tutor who enjoys meeting people who are as passionate about the world of the ancients as I am (""thumos"", or θυμός, from my username roughly means ""spirit"" or ""breath of life""). I'm looking to give back during the quarantine, and so I would like to offer free tutoring sessions for anyone who would like to learn more about ancient languages, history, philosophy, art, or culture.

I was trying to figure out the name of a holiday taking place in ancient Greece (possibly Rome?). I read about it once in a book I now forget the name of. Anyway, the holiday was a celebration of women. It might've gone on for a couple days, but the main gist was that men were not allowed outside at certain times of the day/throughout the day, and women were free to do more than they were usually able to. It might've also taken place during a time when a lot of political decisions were being made for they year. I explicitly remember a scene in the story where an older man is warned that he may be killed by the women if he remained outside, especially during the night.

&amp;#x200B;

Together they guide us into an obscure but important aspect of not just the Late Bronze Age but of the Bronze Age Collapse itself and that is the subject of piracy.

&amp;#x200B;

Are the Sea Peoples merely pirates or is it more complicated?

&amp;#x200B;

What does archaeology tell us about piracy in the Late Bronze Age?

&amp;#x200B;

Were there pirate kings and pirate kingdoms?

&amp;#x200B;

Do we have primary sources on piracy in the Late Bronze Age? Can the Iliad and the Odyssey be taken as a historical source and do these works reflect Bronze Age piracy?

&amp;#x200B;

Why were the Sea Peoples easily defeated in open battle? 

&amp;#x200B;

These are just a few of the subjects that we attack in this fun episode on the Sea Peoples, Piracy and the Bronze Age Collapse.

Do not attribute your troubles to the gods, as if they were fated.  
For you yourselves exalted these men and gave them pledges.  
And that is why you endure evil servitude.  
Each of you follows in the footsteps of a fox,  
Yet you are all devoid of sense.

1610826618,"Were the priesthoods of various Greek gods qualitatively different? Were the priests who served in a Temple of Ares more prone to violence, or priests of Apollo especially likely to be lovers of the arts?","To the modern mind, it’s easy to imagine the priests of a polytheistic religion like that of Ancient Greece to be mini-avatars of their patrons’ ideals. 

Someone who dedicates themselves specifically to Ares seems likely value violence and aggression, while a servant of Aphrodite might be more openly sexual and interested in beauty. One can easily imagine the priests of Dionysus throwing wild parties, while the priests of Athena might be more stern and disciplined. Apollo was the god of music and the arts, so did priests of Apollo have a more artistic streak than those in a temple dedicated to Poseidon?

Obviously such priests were human and it’s impossible to categorically describe them as a unit. But is there any indication that temples dedicated to specific gods attracted particular types of people, or that their rites and rituals encouraged different patterns of behavior based on the god they served?

Or is that a false assumption from a modern perspective, and ancient priests were not differentiated in that way from temple to temple and god to god?",1,were the priesthood of various greek god qualitatively different were the priest who serve in a temple of ares more prone to violence or priest of apollo especially likely to be lover of the art to the modern mind it s easy to imagine the priest of a polytheistic religion like that of ancient greece to be of their patron ideal someone who dedicates themselves specifically to ares seem likely value violence and aggression while a servant of aphrodite might be more openly sexual and interested in beauty one can easily imagine the priest of dionysus throw wild party while the priest of athena might be more stern and discipline apollo be the god of music and the art so do priest of apollo have a more artistic streak than those in a temple dedicate to poseidon obviously such priest be human and it s impossible to categorically describe them a a unit but be there any indication that temple dedicate to specific god attract particular type of people or that their rite and ritual encourage different pattern of behavior base on the god they serve or be that a false assumption from a modern perspective and ancient priest be not differentiate in that way from temple to temple and god to god
1610816629,"History and Terrorism in Washington, D.C. (2021)","In this episode I host a variety of experts on a variety of topics that dive into the riots and insurrection that occurred in Washington D.C. as extremists attempted to attack the foundation of our government and overturn a legal presidential election.

&amp;#x200B;

This episode touches on a variety of points including:

&amp;#x200B;

Historical parallels with Nazi Germany, Mussolini's Italy and the 1934 crisis of France.

&amp;#x200B;

The evolution of modern extremists groups as they attempt to co-opt other conservative banners, flags and images while moving away from controversial hate symbols such as the swastika which can be a turn off to patriotic conservatives.

&amp;#x200B;

Populism and conspiracy theories from the Bronze Age to our present day and attempts by modern politicians to pretend to be populists, manipulate their followers while very much being globalists.

&amp;#x200B;

The holocaust and modern antisemitism as it manifested itself at these riots and attacks on our federal government. And the parallels that we are seeing with not just the Third Reich as the fringe becomes mainstream but the problems surrounding entertainment news and media who in many ways are going down the path of public broadcasting that we saw leading up to the genocide in Rwanda.

&amp;#x200B;

The appropriation, misuse, abuse and misunderstanding of Spartan, Viking / Norse History and Native American History / Culture and how it manifested itself in D.C during the protests and criminal actions that took place.

1608754651,"Zeus, the Demon-God, Brought Winter to the Pelasgians","In studying the legend of Cadmus I have discovered something I find fascinating. Cadmus is credited with bringing writing to Greece and is said to be Phoenician. Thus he is often placed around 800 BC or so by many classical Greeks and later historians. However Herodotus says Cadmus lived 16 centuries before his own time - or 2000 BC - which is long before the Phoenicians came to Greece. We know the Minoans are using linear A by 1800 BC and we have found linear A tablets on mainland greece from shortly after this time period. This is very close to Herodotus' estimation. It could also be referencing Cretan hieroglyphics coming to Greece around 2000 BC but that is more speculative. Therefore, Cadmus is likely much older than many later Greeks believed...and Herodotus might actually have access to special knowledge here that makes his dating a bit more accurate than others. He was after all a member of the Samothrace Cult of the Great Gods, who worshiped the same Earth Mother that Cadmus did.

You see....  (takes deep breath)

Cadmus begins his tale in search of his sister Europa, who has been abducted by Zeus. Europe being conquered by Zeus? Well, we do know that indo-europeans came into Greece around 2000-1900 BC and their primary deity was the sky, which will evolve into Zeus (Dyeu = Sky in indo-european). If Cadmus is Minoan, they would likely see themselves as a sister society to the Pelasgians, and I can see Cadmus as a Minoan hero come ashore to save his fellow Earth Mother goddess worshipers (a Pelasgian version of Gaia or Demeter was likely the primary deity of both Minoans and Pelasgians). There is a lot of Goddess and Sky symbolism in the legend of Cadmus. His reign is said to be unstable. The kingship of Thebes is even lost twice after Cadmus. First to a local nobleman, then to twin 'sons of Zeus'. Thus we get a picture of a tenuous hold on power for the Cadmeian line where they are caught between local nobles representing the old guard and old ways, and the new coming indo-european sky worshipers.

Cadmus lands at Samothrace, where the oracle of the Earth Mother stood (even into Christian times btw...and Herodotus was a member of this cult). He asks the oracles aid but she tells him there is no hope, Europa belongs to the sky now. She then directs him on his actual destiny to become king of Thebes.

Cadmus' legend mirrors that of the later Greek legend of Persephone, daughter of the 'earth mother' goddess Demeter who is carried away to the underworld by Hades, causing Demeter to weep and bring winter. Before Zeus overthrew the Titans and established he and his Olympians as the head gods, he is said to have dwelled in the underworld for a time. Could the Greeks actually be retelling an ancient Pelasgian legend in which they and Zeus are actually the villains that abduct/conquer Europe, bringing her to 'the underworld' and causing the Earth Mother to weep, bringing winter to the Pelasgians and eventually the Minoans?  


I made a video about Cadmus if anyone wants to check it out:

But, for example, why do english speakers say 'Homer, Livy, aristotle, circe', instead of 'Homeros, livius, Aristoteles and Kirke'? It just seems kind of weird to me. Is it just that these words dont sound quite right in english, so that's why they made an ""english friendly"" version of the name?

1606505224,Greek Pottery School Project - ideas,"χαίρετε, ὦ κύριοι;

I'm designing a school project on the topic of Greek Pottery for secundary school students. They are around 15 years old and they are taking an introduction class on ancient classical cultures. I know this might be a long shot, but does anybody here have any idea on how to do it? I'm open to all kind of suggestions! 


For now, this is what I have thought:
- I would like to exhibit this project on the school hall, to maximize visibility.
- As we won't have too much time, I will give an initial presentation on the topic: the different shapes and uses, the motifs and all that.
- The students will draw the motiffs and images on some cheap terracotta flower plates 
- The students will use some playdoh to show the variety of shapes Greek pottery has and make some visual presentation on those shapes (with text and drawings, maybe?).


With this project (and a few others) I want to lure a few students to take ancient Greek classes next year, so wish me the best of luck!

I have read some of his dialogues and some scholars work on the subject and he has degrees in anthropology, comparative religion and mycology. So, it would be amazing if anyone of you could take a look of what we have done and set us straight if it is something that is completely of rails. Especially if you are interested in the subject as we are. I know it is a hard conversation to get into and there is a lot of pretty bonkers twists and turns to digest but I hope it is interesting enough to be worth while for you.

1604948092,Molon Labe and White Supremacism : The most famous phrase never to be spoken ~ Dr. Owen Rees.,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

DID LEONIDAS SAY “MOLŌN LABE” AT THE BATTLE OF THERMOPYLAE?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

CLAIM : When Xerxes’ demanded for the Greeks at Thermopylae to lay down their weapons, Leonidas defiantly replied molōn labe.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""MOLŌN LABE"" the epic phrase most likely never said.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In this video Dr. Owen Rees guides us through the history and historiography of Molon Labe,"" by discussing the sources, the variations of the story and how it evolved over time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But more importantly Dr. Rees touches on the appropriation of this phrase and other aspects of Spartan / Ancient History by modern day white supremacists and other political radicals.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He talks about the dangers of this appropriation as people are easily lead from moderate political stances by these appropriations and misconstructions into often radically dangerous groups.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The evidence for Leonidas defiantly declaring molōn labe to Xerxes is very weak. It does not appear in any near-contemporary accounts of the battle, it does not appear in a historical work about the battle, and it receives its first surviving mention by Plutarch in the first or early second century AD. When it is finally mentioned by Plutarch, it is not a verbal conversation using envoys, but an anachronistic-sounding exchange of letters. For this reason we have deemed this claim to be mostly false: it does appear in an ancient source, but that source appears almost 500 years after the battle.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And so with that being said we have to ask ourselves, why did a Greco-Roman historian want to revision the past? And why do modern radicals still attempt to misconstrue history while screaming and tattooing phrases that were never said?

&amp;#x200B;

Although the rectangular white marble Parthenon has suffered damage over the centuries, including the loss of most of its sculpture, its basic structure has remained intact. 

Ancient ruins like the Parthenon can teach us about the past in a unique way. Through architectural remains, we can gather what building techniques and civilizations were like long ago.

I am a writer and my current longform piece centers around the Mani Peninsula in the 1200s AD.

I realize there's potential for some variability here but I cannot for the life of me find sources or illustrations of this time period as well as for seafaring individuals, so any and all help is much appreciated.

*  ***Ancient Greek science got its roots from Egypt and Mesopotamia***. The trade to Egypt through the Nile allowed the transfer of knowledge and people like Socrates, Pythagoras, Aristotle had visited Egypt.  The three civilizations where science and mathematics had developed early and had great practical uses were **Egypt, Babylonia, Greek**. Greeks were the last to join, but they developed theorems from ideas and mathematical tools which were in use in Babylonia, Egypt. 
*  The Babylonians had developed arithmetical methods of solving problems. Astronomy was a vital part of the Babylonian culture as **they worshipped planetary gods like Greeks**
*  **The first scientist is accepted to be Thales of Miletus.** He might have learned a lot from the Babylonians and Egyptians as his origin is not clear. Later he established mathematics in Greek science and converted mathematics from Babylonia where it got used only as a tool to a part of science itself. The Babylonians also knew about Pythagoras theorem, which got discovered at the same time. 
* The ***Greeks descended from the collapse of an ancient civilization known as Mycenaean***. After the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization, the dark age was upon them for two centuries. The Mycenaeans left only stories and poems about gods that got passed to the Greeks, and that is the reason why their religion is a collection of fairy tales that partially reflects the values and theologies of Mycenaeans. . 
*  One of the primary methods of reasoning which the Greeks followed is as follows “***if all men are mortal; if Socrates is a man; then Socrates is a mortal”***.

1600540658,The Bronze Age Collapse in the Hebrew Bible by Seth Fleishman.," 

In this episode Seth Fleishman from the YouTube Channel ""World History By A Jew,"" takes us into a subject I have really looked forward to and that is the Bronze Age Collapse in the Bible.

In this lecture he explores the Old Testament and shows us the Bronze Age Collapse throughout the Hebrew Bible, while also exploring the world outside of it as well such as explaining what was happening in Egypt, Greece, Anatolia and Canaan, while also discussing many of the sites that were destroyed by the Sea Peoples themselves.

But, we also see those of the Sea Peoples who arrive to ancient Canaan and who also decide to stay such as the Philistines. But also he discusses a controversial subject and that is, is one of the Israelite Tribes part of the Sea Peoples groups?

And we also ask ourselves, how does the Hebrew Bible stand up to history? Can we use it as a historical resource and what should we keep in mind while studying literature and histories that were a major aspect of creating an ancient Israelite identity?

1600451354,Philistine Society in Ancient Canaan ~ Dr. Aren Maeir," 

In this episode Dr. Maeir guides us through Philistine Society and what little bit of information that we know about them.

Was it a hierarchical society? Is their societal structure due to their relationship to Greece? Are there problems with this hypothesis?

What was the relationship between Philistine cities? Were they separate or united? Was Inter-Philistine Competition? Were the Philistines truly a militaristic society?

It also deals with the lack of textual evidence and also brings up the problematic portrayals of the Philistines in ancient Israelite texts like the Bible.

The Philistines were an ancient people who lived on the south coast of Canaan from the 12th century BC until 604 BC, when they were exiled to Mesopotamia by King Nebuchadnezzar II. They are known for their biblical conflict with the Israelite's. Though the primary source of information about the Philistines is the Hebrew Bible, they are first attested to in reliefs at the Temple of Ramses III at Medinet Habu, in which they are called Peleset (accepted as cognate with Hebrew Peleshet); the parallel Assyrian term is Palastu, Pilišti, or Pilistu.

1599057041,"For those who have read Herodotus and Thucydides - If you could advise your past self from when you were about to first read those two books, would you tell them to read with or without the introduction/notes?","Today I can say I possess both Tom Holland's translation of *The Histories* that he did for Penguin, and Martin Hammond's translation of *The Peloponnesian War* for Oxford University Press, and I want to able to get as much out of them as I can. Both of them come with quite extensive notes (the latter more than the former), which one would think would be useful for a better understanding of the text. However, in the past, I attempted to get going with *The Peloponnesian War*, checking the notes every time, and I just felt frustrated with the lack of pace and confused about the order and context of events anyway, and I shelved it before finishing Book I.

As should be obvious from the title, I'm considering trying to (initially) read them through, beginning to end, without consulting the notes. Is this something you would advise to yourself if you had to learn Herodotus and Thucydides from scratch again?

1599052846,Looking for help with a paper on ships of ancient greece,"English is not my native language so excuse me please for messing up the terminology.

Hello everyone, I'm a student of japanese language and culture and I took a random class on the antiquities of the ancient civilizations. I have to write a seminar paper, and the topic is greek ships. My college doesn't have much on the topic, and the one book I got from my professor has like two pages on the topic of greek ships (half a page on ships of Homer's time - transport/merchant ships, and a page and a half on militaristic ships that came after).

Since the only option I have is using the internet to find some sources, I got kinda stuck since most articles and papers I could find are about the latter sort of ships. I'm not used to writing this sort of a paper, and I hope some of you might be able to help me find a credible source with a bit more on the matter.

I do love everything about ancient greece, but most of what I studied was about mythology, so this topic is kinda... Out of my reach.

Please let me know if there are any good books or papers you might know of, especially on the oldest sorts of ships, from before they started using them for battles. Thank you!!!",1,looking for help with a paper on ship of ancient greece english be not my native language so excuse me please for mess up the terminology hello everyone i a student of japanese language and culture and i take a random class on the antiquity of the ancient civilization i have to write a seminar paper and the topic be greek ship my college do have much on the topic and the one book i get from my professor have like two page on the topic of greek ship half a page on ship of homer time ship and a page and a half on militaristic ship that come after since the only option i have be use the internet to find some source i get kinda stuck since most article and paper i could find be about the latter sort of ship i not use to write this sort of a paper and i hope some of you might be able to help me find a credible source with a bit more on the matter i do love everything about ancient greece but most of what i study be about mythology so this topic be kinda out of my reach please let me know if there be any good book or paper you might know of especially on the old sort of ship from before they start use them for battle thank you
1599039591,during the 5th century BC was Athens burned down once or twice by the Persians?,"this is just a quick question if someone wouldn't mind answering!

I'm writing an essay and got stuck on this technicality.

A moving, powerful journey deep into the oldest music in the Western world, guided by the eccentric musicologist who has dedicated his life to understanding &amp; preserving it. An immersive sonic &amp; visual feast that leaves the viewer feeling they've looked into a way of life that the 21st century has left behind. A call to arms for a different way of listening to music, understanding humanity and living as a community.

The world’s oldest mourning song, the mirologi unchanged in the mountain villages of Zagoria, a part of the ancient Greek province of Epirus, close by the Albanian border.  
For three days every year, an unceasing festival of song is held there, its purpose: to heal life’s wounds for all who hear it and dance to it. For one man, it became a path from death, back into life.

“Love your life, and live it, but remember the dead, and that you won’t always be here.”

The music of Epirus is played so that people can dance to it, drink and be transported from their troubles, while also remembering their loved ones who have passed on.

1598711857,New Chronology by Dr. David Rohl," 

New Chronology is an alternative chronology of the ancient Near East developed by English Egyptologist David Rohl and other researchers beginning with A Test of Time: The Bible - from Myth to History in 1995. 

It contradicts mainstream Egyptology by proposing a major revision of the established Egyptian chronology, in particular by re-dating Egyptian kings of the Nineteenth through Twenty-fifth Dynasties, bringing forward conventional dating by up to 350 years. 

David Rohl's published works A Test of Time (1995), Legend (1998), The Lost Testament (2002), and The Lords of Avaris (2007) set forth Rohl's theories for re-dating the major civilizations of the ancient world. A Test of Time proposes a down-dating (bringing closer to the present), by several centuries, of the New Kingdom of Egypt, thus needing a major revision of the conventional chronology of ancient Egypt. 

Rohl asserts that this would let scholars identify some of the major events in the Hebrew Bible with events in the archaeological record and identify some of the well-known biblical characters with historical figures who appear in contemporary ancient texts. Lowering the Egyptian dates also dramatically affects the dating of dependent chronologies, such as that currently used for the Greek Heroic Age of the Late Bronze Age, removing the Greek Dark Ages, and lowering the dates of the Trojan War to within two generations of a ninth-century-BC Homer and his most famous composition: the Iliad.

The New Chronology, one of several proposed radical revisions of the conventional chronology, has not been accepted in academic Egyptology, where the conventional chronology or small variations of it remains standard.

I know a lot of them take place around the Trojan War, for instance, but were the stories themselves already widely known?

Furthermore, would there be any sort of chronology to these plays? Any general order in which they’d take place, as if they were a sort of episodic series?

Obviously, I haven’t read all of the tragedies, and I do realize this might be a stupid and possibly unanswerable question, but I would like to try and place them into a rough timeline before I delve into them.",1,do the greek tragedy portray the myth is there a timeline not sure if this be the right sub to ask this but i couldn t think of anywhere else to go do the most of work by aeschylus sophocles euripides etc portray the already exist story that the ancient greeks believe or be they essentially brand new story write by the playwright i know a lot of them take place around the trojan war for instance but be the story themselves already widely know furthermore would there be any sort of chronology to these play any general order in which they d take place a if they be a sort of episodic series obviously i haven t read all of the tragedy and i do realize this might be a stupid and possibly unanswerable question but i would like to try and place them into a rough timeline before i delve into them

The Italian wiki claims that the original language of the film was Italian, but all of the Italian versions I have found are dubbed. If indeed all of the actors are speaking their native language, can an undubbed multinlingual version be found? Any recommendations of a definitive version would be enormously appreciated.

1589838667,Nietzsche's Dionysian and real life Greeks,"I presume that more than a few historians in this subreddit are familiar with Nietzsche's extremely influential notions of Apollonian and Dionysian. (They were after all one of his most enduring contributions to philosophy.) Upon reading his firstborn The Birth of Tragedy, one would feel reasonably justified in seeing the two notions loosely mapping to Freud's more famous notions of life and death drive. Indeed, Nietzsche offers a certain primacy to Dionysian, the same way late Freud does to death drive, in a move which shocked many of his most ardent followers, let alone general public. Nevertheless, upon further acquaintance with Nietzsche (and Freud, mind you), it is increasingly clear that no matter how strikingly similar their respective philosophies of drive/desire/will (or should one say meta-psychologies) are in many a respect, their overall outlook is decidedly different. Nietzsche would accuse Freud of being ahistorical and blind to the profound historical catastrophe brought about by the victory of slave morality, and Freud would probably for his part accuse Nietzsche of wishful thinking: I am saying it how it is, unlike you who try to endow Man with loftiness and vitalism of which he knows not. You are way too smart and profound to sincerely believe in that wasteful and creative desire stemming from superabundance and inner loftiness. It is precisely this point of contention that has preoccupied my thoughts for quite some time. While I wish I could side with Nietzsche, I cannot help but consider Freud's account more in accordance with the state of things. But then again, my impressions may be rather skewed due to me being a human of late capitalism. Which brings me to my question. The late Nietzsche effectively and decisively moved away from his early artist's metaphysics to naturalism and Apollo had vanished from his writings. The opposition between the two is merely dialectical, it was always Dionysian monism and nothing else. He writes (I'm quoting from memory): Saying Yes to Life even in its strangest and hardest problems, the will to Life rejoicing in its inexhaustability even in the sacrifice of its highest types, that is what I called Dionysian, that is what I guessed to be the bridge towards the psychology of the tragic poet.

1587436697,Possible Mycenean Influence in Northern Germany,"So, I've recently been reading up on the Bronze Age and it's subsequent collapse.  I just finished Eric Cline's "" 1177 BC"" and loved it.  Looking for my next book on Amazon I came across what may be considered more or less ""Pseudo-Archaeology"" books regarding the placement of the Trojan War not in the Aegean, but Baltic Sea.

The idea may be a little far fetched, and Im not entirely on board myself, but some further digging did bring up some interesting things I didn't know of or even consider regarding Bronze Age Germany and northern Europe.  Such as the mysterious battle of Tollense Valley, chariot warfare, hilled Military forts in the area and the appearance of a lot of Bronze and Tin items and tools in the area a lot sooner than Archaeologists would at first believe.

So, what I'm curious about is exactly how much interaction did the Germans, Danes, Norwegians, etc have with the Myceneans, Egyptians and Anatolians of the Bronze Age.  Apparently more than we'd think given the weapons and tools they had available to them.  How could have these interactions taken place?  Possible conquests and raids by the Mediterranean Bronze Age Cultures? Trade?  How much archaeological evidence do we have of the civilizations coming in contact?

If there are any experts on the subject or if anyone could recommend any good or reliable sources such as lectures or books/essays on the subject I'd love to further my research.  I find the mystery of it all very fascinating.",1,possible mycenean influence in northern germany so i recently be reading up on the bronze age and it subsequent collapse i just finish eric cline bc and love it looking for my next book on amazon i come across what may be consider more or less book regard the placement of the trojan war not in the aegean but baltic sea the idea may be a little far fetch and im not entirely on board myself but some far dig do bring up some interest thing i do know of or even consider regard bronze age germany and northern europe such a the mysterious battle of tollense valley chariot warfare hill military fort in the area and the appearance of a lot of bronze and tin item and tool in the area a lot sooner than archaeologists would at first believe so what i curious about be exactly how much interaction do the germans danes norwegians etc have with the myceneans egyptians and anatolians of the bronze age apparently more than we think give the weapon and tool they have available to them how could have these interaction take place possible conquest and raid by the mediterranean bronze age cultures trade how much archaeological evidence do we have of the civilization come in contact if there be any expert on the subject or if anyone could recommend any good or reliable source such a lecture or on the subject i love to far my research i find the mystery of it all very fascinate

This follows the spread of tales from Egypt to the Greek World and what role mercenaries played in spreading these tales. 

Primary Argument Presented: That Mercenaries served as an overlooked conduit for technology transfers and tales, connecting not only the ""civilized"" Ancient Near East Mediterranean but also the ""Barbarian"" periphery.

This lecture deals with these main points:

(1) Uluburun and possible Northern connections.

(2) Review of the use of mercenaries in the Ancient Near East Mediterranean.

(3) Mycenaean and possible European military presence in New Kingdom Egypt.

(4) Similar tales or common originals?

1587146990,The Bronze Age Collapse and the Onomasticon of Amenope,"The Onomastica of Amenope contains a word list for groups of things varying from the list of what is contained in the heavens, to the towns of Egypt, to the parts of an oxen and its kind of meat. It is generally accepted that the Onomastica of Amenope dates to the late Twentieth Dynasty and is known from at least ten copies or fragment versions on papyrus, a writing board, a strip of leather, and several potsherds.

The Onomastica was used for administrative purposes but was also used for teaching scribes. Gardiner’s translation of the Onomastica is widely consulted, and its excellence has in some ways discouraged other scholars from studying the Onomastica. The most important section for our purposes is chapter 4, which lists the class, tribes, and types of human beings in the region. In this listing there are many references to the tribes of the Sea Peoples (Simpson 2001: 605).

The Onomasticon of Amenope, or Amenemipit (amen-em-apt), gives a slight credence to the idea that the Ramesside kings settled the Sea Peoples in Canaan. Dated to about 1100 BCE, at the end of the 21st dynasty (which had numerous short-reigned pharaohs), this document simply lists names.

After six place names, four of which were in Philistia, the scribe lists the Sherden (Line 268), the Tjeker (Line 269) and the Peleset (Line 270), who might be presumed to occupy those cities. The Story of Wenamun on a papyrus of the same cache also places the Tjeker in Dor at that time.

The fact that the Biblical maritime Tribe of Dan was initially located between the Philistines and the Tjekker, has prompted some to suggest that they may originally have been Denyen. Sherden seem to have been settled around Megiddo and in the Jordan Valley, and Weshwesh (connected by some with the Biblical tribe of Asher) may have been settled further north.

1587123881,How did Athens really control its 'Empire'?,"How did fifth century Athens control the states of the Delian League? I know the league is often likened to an Athenian Empire, as they took taxes etc from the states and eventually forced them to remain in the 'alliance' through force, but how did Athens actually control the states politically? E.G. In Rome, there were governors for each province that held legal/official control, and for each province there were treaties etc stating what they had given up when they were conquered. Was there any equivalent in the 'Athenian Empire'? I know the Roman Empire was much, much bigger than the Athenian Empire so would have used more administration anyway, but I guess I'm asking whether the power of the 'Empire' was anything more than the Athenians stealing money from other cities on the pretence of taxes. Were the Athenians bothered with the politics of the member states?

Any sources/citations would be gratefully received.

Think of it as the anti-300.","I’ve found a great historical fiction comic book that I think you guys will enjoy. Three is created by Kieron Gillen and Ryan Kelly. It is set in Ancient Sparta. Specially, after Sparta is Past it’s prime and suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Thebes. Three follows, well, three helots. They’ve accidentally killed their master and now they’re on the run. A band of 300 Spartan warriors have been assembled to hunt them down. Three is often referred to as the anti-300, because it takes a more historically accurate view of Sparta. It has fantastically impeccable research. In fact, there’s an interview with a professor of Spartan history after the story has ended, and the creators discuss the reaserch they did.

So great story, great artwork, great research, an all around great comic book. If you haven’t already, check it out now, you’ll be glad you did.

There is geographical evidence, Herodotus (The father of History) famously showed it on a map, and it's existence is spoke about in Plato's Timaeus and Critias. There is something called the eye of the Sahara, that I strongly suggest you google. And it was said that it was right below the Atlas mountains. (Which are real) and you can look it up.
.
If you say yes, and believe it's underwater, or you say no, I strongly recommend watching Bright Insights YouTube video on Atlantis. I promise you you'll gain a new perspective on Atlantis. Even if you already believe it existed.
.
And if his video isn't enough to convince you, he made a second video on it, and adding to the evidence.
.
Besides, ancient city's have disappeared before without leaving any materialistic evidence behind. And ancient civilizations have disappeared without a trace before. Infact, we don't know how many have disappeared without a trace. We literally couldn't. That's the point of leaving without a trace. For all we know, there could have been an extra 200 civilizations that existed that we we don't and never will know about. So there's not much rational reason to believe Atlantis is an exception.

This is the case no matter the gender of your character

Throughout the game, you also see Spartan women as soldiers, as well as alot of women mercenaries.

So I have one question. Since I'm not well versed in Greek history, and onlineresearch has proven vague, I was wondering if Spartan women were allowed to be soldiers?

1586009980,Plague in the ancient and medieval world.,"The word 'plague', in defining a lethal epidemic, was coined by the physician Galen (l. 130-210 CE) who lived through the Antonine Plague (165 - c. 180/190 CE) but the disease was recorded long before in relating the affliction of the Plague of Athens (429-426 BCE) which killed many of the city’s inhabitants, including the statesman Pericles (l. 495-429 BCE). This epidemic, and some of the others that followed, may or may not have been actual plague as it was later defined; ancient writers tended to use the term plague for any widespread outbreak of pestilence.

Plagues certainly may have existed prior to the Athenian outbreak – and almost certainly did – but most studies of the epidemic begin with Athens as it is the first recorded by an eyewitness and survivor, the historian Thucydides (l. 460/455 - 399/398 BCE). Plagues are routinely named either for the person who reported them, the monarch at the time of the outbreak, the region afflicted, or by an epithet as in the case of the Black Death.

It is actually incredible just how influential Ancient Greece was. From essentially founding philosophy and biology they also really set the pace for mathematics, physics, medicine and many other disciplines.

Then you look into the Roman Empire and how much they took from the Greeks, then the founding fathers of Christianity how much they incorporated from Plato and Aristotle as well. Furthermore, even the theory of atoms (albeit much different) began in Greece as well as what we later learned about the cosmos through Copernicus.

The fact that Alexander the Great conquered half of the known world that mixed the west and the east and really brought very directly the culture that we even have to this day.

1585411932,"Silver, Ships, Olives, and Mercenaries: Contacts Between Egypt and the Greek World (1600-1200 B.C) by Doctor Jorrit Kelder.","Connections between Ancient Egypt and the Mycenaean world have often been understood in terms of indirect exchange, via middlemen on Cyprus and in the Levant. 

This view is mainly informed by the relative paucity of Mycenaean pottery found in Egypt, especially when compared to the large amounts of Mycenaean pottery found on Cyprus and the Levant. 

It will be argued in this presentation that connections between Egypt and Mycenae were of direct, diplomatic nature and that various different missions can be identified over the course of the 15th to 13th centuries BC. 

To prove this belief, the lecture presents a range of archaeological, iconographical and textual evidence coming both from Egypt and the Mycenaean world.

An hour ago, I finally pulled the trigger and will be visiting Greece next Tuesday through the following Thursday!  I'm hoping some of you can give me recommendations on where to visit.  Athens is obvious (though lesser-known recommendations within Athens are welcome), and Sparta seems to be a given as well.  But where else would you visit if you had 9 days in Greece to explore the Classical Age?  Would you hit the big cities like Corinth and Thebes?  Or are there some smaller sites that are really worth the effort?  I'm interested in the big monumental-type ruins of course, but I'm also--and perhaps more-so--interested in sites that show how regular people lived and got on, ways to really immerse myself in what it was like to be there.  Any lodging, food, or transportation recommendations in those locations are also much appreciated.

Scion, for those unaware, is a tabletop rpg about mythology, where the player characters are so called Scions, people who have a scrap of divine power from a particular god in them that they can use to perform great heroic feats and such. The game's default setting is a modern times ""All myths are true"" setting, but it can do historical campaigns taking place in the past just as easily. The game has a selection of different pantheons to choose from, and one is greco-roman, so inspired by playing a little Assassin's Creed Odyssey and the recently released Theros block of Magic The Gathering, I decided to do a slightly high fantasy-ish campaign of the game taking place in a version of ancient Greece where all myths are true, and of course with all player characters being scions of the Greek pantheon exclusively. I love Greek mythology but know very little about Greek history, so I was looking for a bit of help, namely two questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Just generally, what advice would you give to not make the world be some caricature of Grecian historical stereotypes?
2. What specific time period of Grecian history would you recommend this game take place in? Why? Are there any ideas for stories that you can think of based on the historical context at the time?

I'm currently working on Herodotus' queens for my master' thesis. There are like 20 queens displayed, and I found out many ways to see them: some are clever (Artemisia, Semiramis, Nitocris of Babylon, Amestris...), some are passive or only giving birth (Mandane...), some are political advisors (Artemisia again, Atossa, Pheretime...), some are cunning (Etearchus wife, Candaules' wife, Tomyris...), some are killers (Tomyris, Artemisia, Nitocris of Egypt), and so on...

But my main struggle is that i can't find a good question/sentence and a good structure to put my ideas cleverly on the paper. I have a lot of connections to make between the queens but i have no idea on how i could present them. 

So i decided to post here (my very first post on reddit !) to see if maybe anyone of you guys could help me just by giving me tips on how to write it, what question i could ask, or to find some other connections that i still haven't found... So far i still can't figure if Herodotus wrote the queens this way to show a single idea in the background of the Histories, or if we just can't connect some queens.

Then from the yoke loosed their war-steeds sweating, and each by his chariot
Tethered his horses with thongs. And then they brought from the city,
Hastily, oxen and goodly sheep; and wine honey-hearted
Gave them, . . . and corn from the houses.
Firewood they gathered withal; and then from the plain to the heavens
Rose on the winds the sweet savor. And these by the highways of battle
Hopeful sat through the night, and many their watchfires burning
Even as when in the sky the stars shine out round the night-orb,
Wondrous to see, and the winds are laid, and the peaks and the headlands
Tower to the view, and the glades come out, and the glorious heaven
Stenches itself to its widest, and sparkle the stars multitudinous,
Gladdening the heart of the toil-wearied shepherd-even as countless
Twixt the black ships and the river of Xanthus glittered the watchfires
Built by the horse-taming Trojans by Ilium.""",1,quote from the iliad copy from the life of greece thus make harangue to them hector and roar the trojans applaud then from the yoke loose their sweat and each by his chariot tethered his horse with thong and then they brought from the city hastily ox and goodly sheep and wine gave them and corn from the house firewood they gather withal and then from the plain to the heaven rose on the wind the sweet savor and these by the highway of battle hopeful sat through the night and many their watchfires burning even a when in the sky the star shine out round the wondrous to see and the wind be laid and the peak and the headland tower to the view and the glade come out and the glorious heaven stenches itself to it wide and sparkle the star multitudinous gladdening the heart of the a countless twixt the black ship and the river of xanthus glitter the watchfires built by the trojans by ilium

1556739156,Homer's Iliad describes proto-Celtic clan wars,"By iteratively comparing similar passages in the Iliad and creating lists of common oral characteristics, I have been able to distinguish five different oral traditions that precede the texts of the legendary Homer. The second of these five, which I called the European Beta-tradition, is probably the most fascinating tradition among them, because it must be linked to a series of enigmatic historical issues: the raids of the Sea Peoples, the movements of the Urnfield Peoples, the fall of the Mycenaean and the Hittite empires, the onset of the Greek Dark Ages and the invasions of the Dorians in Greece. I hypothesize that the merger of the Urnfield Peoples with the Tumulus Peoples in an overpopulated Central Europe has created a warlike ideology or religion that used clever tactics to spread across Europe and, indeed, the Mediterranean region. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is how the European Beta-tradition must have arrived in Greece after the fall of the Mycenaean Empire. The battle scenes in the Iliad go back on wars between proto-Celtic clans in Central Europe, rather than stemming from Mycenaean Greece. This is why the Greeks built a wall from wood and earth surrounded by a ditch in the Iliad. These are the defense structures that we find across Europe, but not in mountainous Greece, which has stone castles without ditches. The ditch plays a central role in one of the typical scenes of the European Beta-tradition, namely gathering up the army for the fight. Also the strong similarities with the funeral habits of the Urnfield and Tumulus peoples and the accounts of Caesar and Diodorus of Sicily about the Celts and the Gauls point in the direction of Central Europe. 

&amp;#x200B;

1552271763,What If Ancient Greece Had Taken Over The World? (Fantasy Meets History),"**Warning: Apologies for the length, this is a complex topic. I don't expect everyone to read it. Feedback's welcome:**

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working since 9th grade (currently out of college) on an alternate history adventure story mixed with elements of Mythological lore and would appreciate a little help. I'm consulting multiple historians to make it as close to plausible as possible, balancing the alternate history at the forefront with the fantasy elements initially staying in the background.

&amp;#x200B;

The setting &amp; premise basically come down to one question, which I'd love to hear thoughts, ideas, suggestions, and criticism on from any knowledgeable students of history &amp; Greek Mythology out there. Please feel free to educate me about the likelihood of this concept, how it could have happened, and how I'd be essentially rewriting centuries of history.

&amp;#x200B;

It all starts with the trillion-dollar question: ""What if the Greek Empire not only survived but became the dominant culture in the world, essentially replacing North America's power/influence?"" What would a modern Ancient Greece look like? How would the people have likely evolved compared to other cultures? Which cultures would be likely to still exist?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm envisioning a world where several other peoples are still around such as some variants of Europeans and Asians, albeit with weaker/smaller/poorer societies compared to the dominant Greeks who are either ruled by them, are currently at war with them, or distance themselves from them. So, which cultures have the most probability to survive?

&amp;#x200B;

How would the Greeks' architecture have evolved? How would their technology have advanced and how similar of a direction would it have gone to our own (plumbing, agriculture, electricity, science, fire-arms, combustion-engine, etc)? How would their economy &amp; laws evolve? Ex- Would they become a Direct Democracy, Democratic Republic, dictatorship?

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify, I'm NOT suggesting taking this all the way to modern times or even the 1900's and speculating on how they may have shaped cars, cell phones, or computers. The furthest I'd go is probably the 1800's, maybe an equivalent to Victorian London in chronology &amp; what level their technology would be (Ex- Horse-drawn carriages are still common)?

&amp;#x200B;

How would their fashion, armor, and battle tactics have likely advanced? What about their police, army, navy? How would their politics &amp; philosophy have evolved compared to common philosophical principles we've adopted? What would their educational system be like? What would their relationship or lack-there-of be with the Greek Gods after so long?

&amp;#x200B;

1548434523,Are Aphrodite and Venus interchangeable in post-classical art?,"
I am writing a thesis about Aphrodite with a strong focus on paintings 
from the renaissance and modernity and I am having the problem that many
paintings (especially during the renaissance) are tributed to ""Venus""
not ""Aphrodite"". 

Now I have gone through some wikis and texts and from what I've gathered
these 2 names (from 2 different godesses) have become interchangable as time passed by.  

Is this correct? To give you an example: When visiting the Wikipedia article about Aphrodite (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite#Post-classical_culture)
almost all the pictures are namend after ""Venus"" not ""Aphrodite"".

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for your help!

&amp;nbsp;

Hello everyone. 

I am a university student in Vienna currently taking a class in „Visual Sociology„ and I am planning on writing my bachelor thesis during this lecture. I have always been interested in ancient Greece (though I also freely admit that I know very little about it) and writing a thesis about it seemed like a fitting idea.

Now, since I am still at the beginning of my thesis, I still have to figure out what exactly my topic should be. Since the class I am taking is about “Visual Sociology” I am obviously more interested in the visual aspects while historical, social or cultural aspects will take a bit of a backseat (but aren’t irrelevant!).

As the title suggests one topic I would be very interested in is the physical appearance of women in ancient Greece. This however is where I start running into problems. As I have mentioned I know very little about ancient Greece and don’t really know where to start. My main concern is that I want to make sure that I will find enough literature (and pictures) for my topic which is why I am posting here. 

&amp;nbsp;

Basically I am looking for any advice, sources (literature, pictures, ect) that would help me narrow down my project.

For example I was thinking of focusing on the body image of women in ancient Greece (i.e. the “ideal female body” during that time) or maybe I want to focus more on clothing, hairstyles and jewelry. I was even thinking of choosing one specific goddess and then focus on just her physical appearance.

&amp;nbsp;

According to my theory, four of the five oral traditions have been translated into the fifth and last oral tradition (an Ionic tradition). I know there have been many Analysts/Oralists/Neo-analysts analyzing the Homeric texts, but they typically only distinguish between different authors, editing layers, and linguistic layers (like the Aeolic and Mycenaean variants/remnants that fit the hexameter better than Ionic). I wonder whether any other Homerist (or other ancient text expert) has ever distinguished between different oral *traditions*. When I say oral tradition, I mean something that can be characterized by about 40-50 semantically meaningful oral characteristics, like king, battle field, ship, guest friendship, etc. and/or oral performance techniques, such as Homeric similes, digressions, superlatives, repetitions, etc., and that can potentially be translated, as a whole, into another or a younger language or dialect.

1539607830,How important was individual skill in formation fighting? Why train an individual soldier to his weapon as a solo fighter?,"Before I created my account on reddit, I saw two posts much earlier this year when I was lurking.

https://old.reddit.com/r/MilitaryHistory/comments/7vkyb0/how_important_is_individual_marksmanship_is_in/

https://old.reddit.com/r/ArmsandArmor/comments/7sxy9c/does_the_skill_of_individuals_in_martial_arts_and/

As both discussions state,indeed you always see the notion of ""teamwork trumps all"" in beginners book on history and history channel documents as well as internet discussions. I am wondering if individual skills matter in formations too? For example would how well a Roman raw recruit could stab his sword an important factor in formation? Like the poster in the two links state many statements such as ""the side whose phalanx holds together longest will wins"" makes it sound as though its pointless to learn how to aim at a target when throwing javelins at a mass of enemies. However even formation-heavy cultures like the Romans still emphasized training an individual to be both in his best physical shape and to individually stab at an enemy in single combat or aim at wooden target dummies to practise hitting darts on with individual marksmanship.

Is formation simply an automatic force multiplier like many TV shows or 5th grade history books imply? Since its always pointed out that the individual doesn't matter but the team does in pop history media such as games? Why even bother teaching a new Roman recruit in bootcamp the weak points of the human body or make an English yeoman practise his own bow skills by shooting targets as an individual if formations is the most important thing? I mean if you're going to shoot volleys I don't see why its important a javelineer  be taught how to throw a spears at the farthest distance possible. If you're going to be protected by a phalanx, why teach Athenian militia how to use his spear to parry and defend against attacks?

Can anyone explain why Mongol light cavalry would be taught how to hold a spear properly for a single jousting style duel even though his role is to be a hit-run archer? Or why Romans had young boys just recruited into camp practise one-on-one dueling if the Roman formations are what win battles?

1539549797,"When you're in a shieldwall, do you feel impact of men rushing in (especially if they tackled you during the process)? As well as force of blows with weapons? How were shieldwalls able to hold on despite kinetic impact and physics?","Related with this post I made.

https://old.reddit.com/r/wma/comments/9o4cui/when_you_block_an_attack_with_a_shield_will_you/

So I'm curious after the results of my experiment, do men in shieldwall formations feel the exact same stuff I did when enemies rush in (especially in a disorganized charge like the Celts typically did)? Especially as their body tackles the shield wall and they swing their weapons in a melee?

If so, how could shield hold on in a very organized interconnected wall despite the kinectic energy and physics forces that would come after the enemy rams into the shields of individual soldiers and they swing their heavy weapons at each person in the wall? I mean I had enough difficulty against civilian grade weapons trying to block and parry in my experiment so I can't understand how an individual Roman soldier could take on the full body of a raging berseker without falling down and creating a gap in the shieldwall or how a shieldwall can stay interconnected despite a barrage of heavy swings of ax and hammer nonstop? 

I know war shields used by knights, Romans, Hoplites, Vikings, etcwere much heavier, stronger, and larger than the Cold Steel Buckler I bought so thats obviously a factor. But I cannot understand how shieldwalls can hold for hours despite nonstop blows (especially the first one which Roman accounts often describe as a barbarian running in and hurling himself at a shield)!

Can anyone explain how the shieldwall works to remain connected  despite impactful attacks?",1,when you in a shieldwall do you feel impact of men rush in especially if they tackle you during the process as well a force of blow with weapon how be shieldwalls able to hold on despite kinetic impact and physic related with this post i make so i curious after the result of my experiment do men in shieldwall formation feel the exact same stuff i do when enemy rush in especially in a disorganize charge like the celts typically do especially a their body tackle the shield wall and they swing their weapon in a melee if so how could shield hold on in a very organize interconnect wall despite the kinectic energy and physic force that would come after the enemy ram into the shield of individual soldier and they swing their heavy weapon at each person in the wall i mean i have enough difficulty against civilian grade weapon try to block and parry in my experiment so i ca understand how an individual roman soldier could take on the full body of a rag berseker without fall down and create a gap in the shieldwall or how a shieldwall can stay interconnect despite a barrage of heavy swing of ax and hammer nonstop i know war shield use by knight romans hoplites vikings etcwere much heavier strong and large than the cold steel buckler i bought so thats obviously a factor but i can not understand how shieldwalls can hold for hour despite nonstop blow especially the first one which roman account often describe a a barbarian run in and hurl himself at a shield can anyone explain how the shieldwall work to remain connect despite impactful attack
1539543168,"When you block an attack with a shield, will you always feel the impact transfer to your body (such as ringing and kinetic force that affects how the shield is held)? How do skilled fighters avoid getting off balanced and dropping a shield by a hard powerful blow?","My Cold Steel Buckler arrived on Friday. Before I went to HEMA class yesterday, I did an experiment at home on Friday.

I got my friend to hit me with feel force at the area where I was holding my shield with a variety of weapons. First I got him to hit me with my $35 scimitar. I was able to block all blows but I not only felt a ringing sounds and vibration effect on my hand each time I blocked a blow but I felt literally  gravity pushing my shield away. Just as interestingly I felt my whole body feel the impact of the kinetic energy each time I blocked a swing. As in even if I was not moved I felt the rest of my arm feel like I just got punched hard while wearing protective gear and my body could feel like I was just pushed back a bit. I even almost stumbled a few times I got hit.

Than I got my friend to hit me with a  4 feet long 5 lbs clubell. When I was being hit with the scimitar even if I temporary lost one of my footing, I could at least quickly go back to reposition my legs in proper standing and not every blow caused enough energy to make my body move, not even pushed back, even if it felt like someone was pushing me.. However with the bat I practically  lost balance of my shield enough a lot of times I fell down and furthermore even if I was able to not get knocked down, I was literally pushed several feet away enough times to note it. If I wasn't pushed away, my grip on the shield was affected enough that my shield would be knocked out of the way and even unintentionally dropping it a few times. The ringing along made my grip so uncomfortable I felt like dropping it at every blows, even weak ones, and by the time I was done with the bat my hand felt so numb and had a shaky feel to it I had to take a break. Like my nerves were affected directly.

Now when I got my friend to experiment with a 15 lb macebell, not only was the macebell able to get through every blow to break my shield away (even with him doing it controlled to avoid accidents and injuries), but I literally fell down on the ground like I slipped or am exhausted from running in only 3 strikes (and in each and every one of them). It was so terrifying to feel the power like I'm being hit by a car I stopped the experiment after feeling the macebell's impact shortly.

So I am wondering. I already know movies are a bunch of BS so how they show someone hold their shields and not get pushed back or show physical discomfort is flatout wrong I assumed even before I started the experiment. I was definitely expecting to feel some impact. However watching so many HEMA videos and Chinese martial arts online and seeing experts take direct hits from very heavy hammers and such without stumbling or feeling discomfort as they block it in a braced for impact manner made me wonder......... How the heck can they do that?! Even the scimitar already provided difficulty despite being  as light as 1.25 pounds enough I felt theimpact affect my legs enough to almost stumble or move its feet position a bit!

I mean I even tried experimenting with parrying the blows as its in the process of moving and while I felt much less impact, I still felt discomfort and numbness with vibrations in my hand! And thats just with the scimitar and a direct parry just a few moments after the sword was thrown (specifically when the sword still hasn't left from behind the shoulder during the swing)!

Can anyone explain if what I'm feeling is natural? If so how do HEMA fighters and East Asian weapon artists able to not fall to the ground or something when a heavy two handed mace is thrown?  This is my first time using a shield and I only practise HEMA two times a month so I don't know much. In fact this Friday I will attempt this experiment again at the HEMA club. However I'm frustrated and want to learn details!

1530289218,Is this the only reference to Ancient Greece in the Bowie back-catalogue?,"David Bowie’s 1974 album Diamond Dogs was inspired by the dystopian fiction of George Orwell’s 1984 (as well as Big Brother, discussed here, there is another track on the album called 1984). As the album draws to a close, the penultimate track of the original release has Bowie’s persona begging for ‘steel’, more unreality and less personal freedom. It seems as though Bowie is suffering from Stockholm Syndrome brought on by too many William Gibson novels. It is in the chorus where we are confronted by the anachronistic cry of “someone to claim us, someone to follow, someone to shame us, some brave Apollo...”. In a vision of the future it seems odd to see a Classical god being called upon. However there is some sense in Apollo’s inclusion. Perhaps most obviously, a dystopian future would be a morally corrupt one. A simple way to help a listener imagine this society is to start calling on Pagan gods which automatically creates echoes of un-Christian (and therefore dystopian) behaviour. But the use of Apollo makes this specific deity’s inclusion in the lyrics more interesting. Firstly, Apollo had his own oracle at Delphi where there were two famous inscriptions: “know thyself” and “nothing in excess”. Is Bowie suggesting that such advice is what the future needs? They are certainly sage pieces of advice when dealing with issues today, especially in regards to technology. Perhaps Bowie is also thinking that Apollo could provide the cryptic clues needed for a better life; many who journeyed to Delphi thought he would reveal the guidance that they needed to make life-changing decisions. Secondly, and perhaps most interestingly in the context of Bowie’s chorus plea, is Apollo’s link to the Lydian king Croesus. Croesus tried to invade Persia and was captured by King Cyrus. He was about to be burnt to death until he managed to pique Cyrus’ interest in Solon’s advice. Cyrus decides to free Croesus, inspired by Solon’s wisdom, but it is too late - his pyre is already lit. Croesus then calls out to Apollo, begging him to save him - and miraculously he does! Is Bowie suggesting that we are standing on a fire created by our own hubris and now we need the power of Apollo to save us?

1530255467,Did Sappho influence Othello?,"One of the most important pieces of symbolism in Othello is Desdemona’s handkerchief. It is found throughout the play and leads to the downfall of the Moor. This piece of fabric is the focus of some (frankly) quite ridiculous conversations between Iago, Desdemona and Othello to demonstrate the ever-growing jealousy within Othello and the foolishness of his behaviour. When Othello stands on the stage and bellows at the top of his lungs “The handkerchief” three times, it is almost impossible not to ridicule the incongruity of his emotions with this ugly word. Regardless of its inappropriateness as a motive for murder, the handkerchief’s power is undeniable. This should not be a surprise as we learn that an Egyptian “charmer” gave it to Othello’s mother. It is Desdemona’s “first remembrance from the Moor” and is also a symbol of her fidelity to Othello; the handkerchief’s whiteness proves her purity and the strawberry design, “Conserved of maidens' hearts"" (3.4.74-75) is representative of her chastity. Therefore, Othello views the handkerchief with such importance, it is no wonder he starts to unravel when it has been lost and therefore the tissue is not quite as trivial as we think. The weight that this square of cloth carries proves that small items can carry emotional weight which can lead to sentimentality and eventually to irrationality.

Despite Shakespeare’s poetic power, the handkerchief still feels like an odd choice for a protagonist-toppling love token. Each emotionally charged conversation about the handkerchief sounds incongruous, especially when the word ‘handkerchief’ is actually enunciated; it just feels so un-Shakespearean. Why did he not use an item of jewellery or a letter or something other than the spiky-in-the-mouth handkerchief? Perhaps (and this is a big perhaps, with absolutely no evidence to back it up) the answer could lie in a translation of 4 words by the poet Sappho, which recently provoked me to ponder whether there may be a connection between Desdemona’s handkerchief and the Greek muse. To explain, there is a tiny fragment of Sappho that has been translated as, “A handkerchief, dripping with…”. It is impossible to read these words and not hear the sensual charge of this (dripping) handkerchief. What is it dripping with though? It is a question that has led to some interesting ideas, but almost all of them involve the body in some way. Did Shakespeare have access to this Sappho fragment? If he did, it may explain why he felt such confidence in hinging his tragedy around such a seemingly insignificant object. Sappho has breathlessly managed to make the napkin sound both romantic and seedy simultaneously – a feat that Shakespeare also achieves in his play. I would love to hear the thoughts of any scholars on this. Is there any chance that Shakespeare could have been influenced by Sappho's 'dripping handkerchief'? Desdemona's, after all, was itself dripped upon from maidens’ hearts. Ben Jonson famously wrote that Shakespeare knew “little Latin and less Greek”. Wouldn’t it be great if this remnant of Sappho was the “less Greek” he knew?

This week on Myths Your Teacher Hated, the Greek army is going to learn that it can always get worse. You’ll see that snitches get stitches, that Zeus is fickle as shit, and that you should absolutely always listen to omens. Then, in Gods and Monsters, we’ll meet the actual king of the monsters (sorry Godzilla). This is the eighth episode in the epic saga of the Trojan War from Greek mythology.

This is the Myths Your Teacher Hated podcast, where I tell the stories of cultures around the world in all of their original, bloody, uncensored glory.  Modern tellings of these stories have become dry and dusty, but I’ll be trying to breathe new life into them.

1641657397,Octavian response to caesars death,"When news of caesar death reached octavian, he was taking classes at apollonia, macedonia. One of its subjects were military doctrine with the 5 caesars legions drilling for a parthia campaign. Some of its officers, counsel him to stay with them for protection, but he refused, crossing to the region of brundisium in search for political gain. Learning caesars will content, that he was adopted by him and therefore, his primary heir (with 2/3 of his estate). He accepted caesars name, probably throwing away his own cuz it was more modest. Brundisium were a base of operations of eastern campaigns, octavian received a warm reception from caesars veterans there, probably given him courage to “steal” a lot of senatorial money intended for caesars parthian campaign cuz he intended to climb roman political ladder faster. He started marching to rome, using the money to employ caesars veterans and parthia intended soldiers in his army. Reaching rome, he found mark antony rivaling with him on caesars faction hegemony. Octavian got optimates support, as they saw him as a lesser evil than antony, and easier to manipulate. Therefore, antony lost this battle, especially when two of his legion passed over to octavian, “fleeing” to cisalpine gaul

The senate made octavian a senator and gave him veto and commanding power alongside the consuls, sending them with an army to resolve antony as a problem. On c. gaul, antony was besieging brutus brother. Octavian and one of the consuls were nearby, waiting for the other consul to arrive with reinforcements. Antony tried to fight before his forces was outnumbered, but the first consul denied it. Antony laid an ambush between the two armies. The second consul fell on it, but it was reinforced by the first one. In a narrow road, surrounded by marches, a bloody battle ensued. The consul was forced to retreat, but the first consul arrived and majorly defeated antony. Although octavian role was minimal, he was acclaimed imperator by his soldiers. Six days later, another battle took place, now on antonys camp. One of the consuls died inside it, octavian being in the thick of battle, got the eagle from an injured bearer and retrieved the consuls body. Antony lost again and decided to retreat to his reinforcements. The senate demanded that octavian handed over his command to brutus, as the two consuls were dead, but he refused. Brutus troops passed over to octavian, making him to flee

Octavian sent centurions as ambassadors to rome to demand the consulship. With its refuse, he marched on rome to no military opposition, being, therefore, elected consul alongside another caesar nephew. Antony allied himself with lepidus, a leading person of the caesarions. Later on, octavian joined them and they formed the famous 2nd triumvirate

I was impressed with the patience octavian demonstrated when antony denied his wealth, but him marching on rome was nuts. I understand he probably saw that the senate didnt truly respected him, but i dont think it was the best decision. I find the origins of the 2nd triumvirate strange. I see octavian on the higher ground then, why to ally with antony? Perhaps, he wasnt so higher.

As I am wont to mention it, I have a podcast (Ancient History Hound) and have covered a number of topic from ancient Rome (from the Baths through to a mini series on the Kings). I did an episode a few years ago on Hannibal's build up in Spain and how he developed there.

In 2022 I'm going to do a mini series on his battles of Trebia, Trasimene and Cannae. Depending on the interest I may also do more on his movements in southern Italy and perhaps Zama.

Anyway, I'm soon to record the episode I've written on Trebia. So far it looks at the build up (including a short overview of how Hasdrubal ended up in Spain), the characters involved, the units, what happened on the day and shortly after.

I'm always conscious of missing the obvious. So if anyone here has a question or aspect they'd like covered in relation to Trebia I'm all ears. I'll either do a question section at the end or ensure it's answered within the episode.

1640754387,Germanic Barbarian Names,"So when reading late classical/early medieval Roman history I notice some Germanic names crop up that are still extant today. 

Two examples are 
* Roderick
* Frederick 

There are obviously names that have died out like Theoderic, Alaric, Athalaric, Theodohad etc. All the 'Suntha' suffix female names of the Goths seem to be long gone too, which is a shame because they're much prettier than the male names. 

I was wondering if the names Derrick and even Patrick have their origins in these Germanic names? I don't recall coming across a Derrick in this period (it would amused me enough I'd remember).

Second question, while lots of Punic/Jewish Biblical names have survived into the modern period, I suspect these are entirely revived rather than to be a continuum from ancient times.

1640734218,Sharing my research on the ethnicity of Marcus Aurelius,"Marcus Aurelius and his family came from the province of Hispania. Because I make depitctions of Roman emperors I really try my hardest to research what these men looked liked whether they be light or dark. 

I really want to say that I want to keep race out of this as much as possible and focus purely on genealogy and phenotypes. My motive for carrying out this research is to answer the question or at the very least come up with an educated guess based on some evidence on what ethnicity Marcus Aurelius was and whether he had Carthaginian or Celtic ancestry from where his family came from in the province of Hispania. His genealogy points to his family being from that region.

I believe Spain was very diverse at the time filled with people and families who never went back to Carthage after the Punic Wars and the descendants of the Iberians, Celtiberians, Tartessians, Lusitanians, and Vascones. All of which were Celtic and some of which would have had extremely light features. Marcus Aurelius and Commodus could have been a mix of several different ethnicities and of course had Italic ancestry.

I did some research and found these two reconstructed colorized busts of Marcus Aurelius, one of him as an [adult](https://external-preview.redd.it/1bJAOmSxeyLqHGbcTRuGlv0ybtKobblNakcPU8RlS6o.png?auto=webp&amp;s=8b5ea3cdea0d74ece16b21d5bc75da1dc896d043) and a [child](https://preview.redd.it/bv0kx6kw5o251.png?auto=webp&amp;s=cca80cf7dd31060dc5005ef219155101bf1e4926) which are based on the original pigment used. He appears to have brown curly hair and brown eyes. So he moderately dark features. That doesn't really say much as brown hair and brown eyes are extremely prevalent in the majority of humans regardless of ethnicity .

I proposed the idea that he might have had Carthagian or Tunisian ancestry but found it not likely and if he did it was probably very little. In comparison to the people of North Africa, Celtic people were very diverse in their appearance some having tribes having a propensity for white blonde hair and icy blue eyes, others sometimes having red hair and green/blue eyes and some even had extremely white skin with freckles which hugely contrasted their pitch black hair and a sort of golden brown eye color. I know this for a fact because my friends mother is Irish and she has pitch black hair, golden brown eyes, and extremely pale skin with freckles all over her face and body. 

I should also mention that curly hair is very common among some Celtic people. People with red hair are more likely to have wavy or curly hair. Celtic people are more likely to have red hair. You sometimes still see this in Ireland where some men and women have [red afros](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9745daca8d8fc18c375915bdb0cb89fe-lq) since Ireland has been more isolated from Greco/Roman, Frankish, and Anglo Saxon invaders in comparison to the former Celtic Kingdoms that existed throughout Europe. This means the Irish people still hold a very significant amount of genes from their Celtic ancestors since there was less ethnic diversity forced upon them by invasion, conquest and trade. Ireland has always maintained a very isolated attitude towards the rest of Europe and it's been that way even up until the 20th century which in some ways is responsible for all sorts of problems like terrorism throughout the United Kingdom in combination with religious differences and thousands of years of unresolved conflict. The Irish were historically less likely to let in outsiders therefore unlike the original Celtic inhabitants of Britannia there ethnicity remained pure and less diverse as the Celtic Britians were eradicated by interbreeding by conquering Romans and later Anglo Saxon, Norse people and Frankish tribes. 

So perhaps Marcus Aurelius and Commodus inherited their curly hair from a red headed Celtic ancestor and the brownish colored hair and eyes came from an a whole mix of Italic and Greek ancestors. Or it's possible they inherited their brown hair and eyes from a man or woman of Celtic descent? 

All I can say is there sure were a lot of diverse people in the ancient world. 

Usually when I look into the later emperors after the Flavian dynasty. I assume that emperors like Marcus Aurelius were not just one ethnicity or at least purely Italic, but instead I look at the modern world where in huge countries like American and Russia there are many different ethnicities living together and interbreeding. I see the Ancient Roman Empire which stretched from borders of Scottland to the edges of Parthia as no different. And even before the Roman Empire the Greeks had been colonizing and exploring west and northern Europe. As such the Celtic people living in the provinces of Transalpine Gaul, Hispania and Britannia almost certainly married into the aristocracy of  Patrician/Plebian men and their daughters who immigrated to those areas to become farmers as was the custom at the time, serve in the military as infantry police or participate in the many bureaucratic and governmental institutions that connected the provinces to the city of Rome to keep the Empire connected.

The stigma against Patrician-Plebian marriage for example had been declining since the 1st century BC and had started when Pompey the Great had won many victories and was the first Plebian to be awarded a military triumph. So it was becoming more acceptable to the point where in the 6th century a peasant became emperor and married a whore and he's now known as Justinian the Great.

The only reason I'm focusing on skin tone, hair color and eyes is because it's required for me to realistically portray these historical figures in my depictions. I want to get as close as possible to reality. I know that's impossible but I want to attempt to try. It's not a problem with facial features since you can clearly see and study them from their many busts and statues. For example Marcus Aurelius has a less prominent Aquiline nose than his son Commodus which might have been influenced by his mother.

Another interesting fact I found is that Marcus Aurelius and Commodus both have droopy eyes and curly hair which would imply both of those features are genetic. They obviously look very similar being father and son.

I found this research which suggests that droopy eyes can sometimes be a genetic trait of Northern Europeans and that leads me back to the Celtic connection.

&gt;The study, which was published in JAMA Dermatology, included two different groups in order to evaluate the extent to which droopy eyes are of a genetic cause. Of the first group of 5,578 unrelated participants with North European ancestry, 17.8 percent had moderate to severe sagging eyelids When researchers looked at the 2,186 twin participants, they found that within the pairs, 61 percent had inherited their sagging eyelids  
In addition to genetics, the study also found that age, being a male, having lighter skin color, and a higher body mass index (BMI) were all risk factors for sagging under-eye skin. A person with a higher BMI, typically has more fat accumulated than does a normal-weight person, which means their under-eye fat pads have a greater chance of being larger and protruding from the skin more.

Paul McCartney, Commodus and Marcus Aurelius [all have these droopy eyes.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/885043206243377193/925521093882708018/pmama.png) And the Celtic connection comes back again because Paul McCartney's family comes from Ireland.

&gt;It is unknown which part of Ireland Paul McCartney’s paternal side is from, but it is known that they first emigrated from Ireland to Galloway, Scotland, and then on to Liverpool.

Based on this research I find it likely that Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus had moderate to strong Celtic heritage from the locals living in Hispania. He definitely had Italic ancestry as well. Before some people accuse me of being a white supremist or whatever. This does not mean that his skin was particularly very white. Some Celtic people can in fact be darker in appearance and it might have been more common in certain tribes 2000 years ago. Some genealogists suggest that prehistoric Irish people had very dark skin, black hair and blue eyes.

I don't expect everyone to read it, but if you do take the time to read it I thank you and would love to hear any opinions or criticism if you have any.

1640625895,Question about Caesar,"So I have read somewhere that historians seem to think that Caesar had a strange head shape (almost lopsided) due to the shape of his head on a certain bust. Is this true? And if it is, I don't think I agree with historians. 

I cut hair fairly regularly and have cut and seen a lot of different balding people and it got me thinking... So, everyone has more hair on one side of their head due to a preference of sleeping either on their left side or right side. This is because the fabric of your pillow rubs against your head and will pull hairs out. So if you sleep on your left side most of the time, the hair on the left side of your head will be thinner than on the right. This is what I think the abnormal head shape is from.

Could that be true? It's well documented that Caesar was balding, and balding on the top of the head would make the differences in hair density between the two sides of the head appear more exaggerated. So maybe his head wasn't weirdly shaped...maybe he just really liked sleeping on his right side of his body.",0,question about caesar so i have read somewhere that historian seem to think that caesar have a strange head shape almost lopsided due to the shape of his head on a certain bust is this true and if it be i do think i agree with historian i cut hair fairly regularly and have cut and see a lot of different balding people and it get me think so everyone have more hair on one side of their head due to a preference of sleep either on their left side or right side this be because the fabric of your pillow rub against your head and will pull hair out so if you sleep on your left side most of the time the hair on the left side of your head will be thinner than on the right this be what i think the abnormal head shape be from could that be true it well document that caesar be balding and balding on the top of the head would make the difference in hair density between the two side of the head appear more exaggerated so maybe his head be weirdly shape maybe he just really like sleep on his right side of his body

I am writing this post six days before the Kalends of January, which we know is the month of Janus. 

Now this way of ascribing dates was used for practically all of Rome's history. 

The Kalends being the first day of the month, the Nones being the ninth, and the ides being the division in the middle, usually the fifteenth. 

If Caesar had died three days later, folks wouldn't say ""Caesar died on the eighteenth of March"", they would say ""Caesar died three days after the ides of March"" 

It's a very interesting way of looking at dates because the seven day week didn't exist. Your birthday was always in relation to either the Kalends, the Nones, or the Ides. 

This changes in the fourth century, but we hardly hear about how this was done. The admiration for seven days come from the book of Genesis where it is said God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh. 

What was once _Dies Solis_ (Day of the Sun) became _Dies Dominica_ (Day of the Lord) and we see this in many languages such as Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and French. While German, English, and many others retained Dies Solis and hence why we have Sunday. This was done much later by Theodosius in 383. It is the official seal of Christendom in the Roman empire 

But this renaming isn't so much what we're concerned about in this post so much as the implementation of the seven day week and the elimination of the Kalends, Nones and Ides system. 

This must have been very confusing for folks. Is there any ancient material that talks about this transition?

1640439382,How close was Claudius Gothicus to the Roman Senatorial elite?,"We can see how things change when Gallienus dies and the throne is passed to Claudius surnamed Gothicus. 

Valerian and his son, Gallienus grew up in Severan Italy. They were metropolitan Latin men who although not the most elite of that class, was in any case more similar to them than Claudius and Aurelian. 

We remember how the Roman world came to a panic in 69 AD and Vespasian assumed power. A man who would be unthinkable while Nero was alive. The prime men were those related to the Julio-Claudian stock. 

But we see this very interesting shift with Claudius taking the imperial power and fighting the Goths. Almost like old Marius taking the consulship by the horns and fighting the Cimbri. 

What were the Roman senators and Praetorian guard doing at this time? What made them just go with the flow with these Illyrian emperors? Surely the memory of Thrax was not that distant. 

I would think that after Gallienus died, they would at least try to put one of their own men up. But this fierce soldier was able to win their admiration I guess and seeing how fractured the empire was, I guess maybe they noticed beggars can't be choosers? 

I personally like to divide the Crisis of the third century into four periods:
Instability (235-253)
Collapse (253-268)
Recovery (268-276)
Stability (276-284)

So, I am currently in the process of writing the second book for my series based in the Roman Empire, and as I was working, I thought it would be great to add some maps to giving the reader a better picture of the world within the story. However, I am well aware that simply taking maps from the internet is a really good way to get sued for copyright infringement, so I was wondering if there was any place to find pictures that could be used that were either free or inexpensive to purchase. In particular, these were the maps I was hoping to find:

\-Roman Italy with as many labelled cities as possible.

\-Britannia or southern Britannia

\-Gaul, even better if it labels the tribes 

\-The Roman world after Caesar's conquest of Gaul

Where the shepherds  on that glorious night had greeted the infant Saviour, singing in harmony with the host of angels in heavenly joy, a  mixed crowd of harlots and eunuchs lamented for Venus’  lover! How sad this is! What human devotion will be able to atone for such impiety? Where the sacred Child, the baby Saviour, had uttered His cries, that ill-famed rite  shrieked with the wanton grief of those counterfeiting the  laments of Venus. Where the Virgin had borne her child, adulterers were worshipped.  

This wickedness of an earlier age continued to the  time of Constantine, shortly before our day. He deserved  to be prince of the princes of Christ as much through the  faith of his mother Helena as through his own. The outcome proved that she was inspired by God’s plan when she  set eyes on Jerusalem. As co-regent with the title Augusta,  she asked her son to give her a free hand in clearing all the  sites there on which our Lord’s feet had trod, and which  were stamped with remembrances of God’s works for us. She sought to cleanse them of all the infection of profane  wickednesses by pulling down temples and statues, and to  restore them to their rightful allegiance so that the Church  might at last be famed in the land of its beginnings.

1639854148,"Discourse between the philosophical, pagan, and christian traditions in the Roman world","**Augustine** says in his *Civitate Dei* the following 

""  They say that they are called *monsters,* because they demonstrate or signify something; *portents,* because they portend something; and so forth. But let their diviners see how they are either deceived, or even when they do predict true things, it is because they are inspired by spirits, who are intent upon entangling the minds of men (worthy, indeed, of such a fate) in the meshes of a hurtful curiosity, or how they light now and then upon some truth, because they make so many predictions."" (Book 21.8)

**Cicero** talks very much about the fallacies of divinations and even the Bacchnalian rites in his *Divintione*, and also says "" But for my part, believing as I do that the gods do care for man, and that they advise and often forewarn him, I approve of divination which is not trivial and is free from falsehood and trickery."" (On Divinaton)

Augustine condemns these traditions as 'demons', on the other hand Cicero views them with his nonchalant indifference. We likewise see **Seneca** taking this view when he condemns the lifestyle of the multitude and that the wise man practices the reading of philosophy and consults the great men of the past in practically all of his letters to Lucilius and his larger works.

**Celsus** likewise urges this path in life but **Origen** refutes him by saying 

"" For who is there that, on betaking himself to the study of philosophy, and throwing himself into the ranks of some sect, either by chance, or because he is provided with a teacher of that school, adopts such a course for any other reason, except that he believes his particular sect to be superior to any other? For, not waiting to hear the arguments of all the other philosophers, and of all the different sects, and the reasons for condemning one system and for supporting another, he in this way elects to become a Stoic, e.g., or a Platonist, or a Peripatetic, or an Epicurean, or a follower of some other school"" (Contra Celsum)

But I think an excellent description is found in Origen where he says 

"" But since the course alluded to is impossible, partly on account of the necessities of life, partly on account of the weakness of men, as only a very few individuals devote themselves earnestly to study, what better method could be devised with a view of assisting the multitude, than that which was delivered by Jesus to the heathen? And let us inquire, with respect to the great multitude of believers, who have washed away the mire of wickedness in which they formerly wallowed, whether it were better for them to believe without a reason, and to have become reformed and improved in their habits "" (Contra Celsum)

**Zosimus** gives us an accout of what **Theodosius** said to the pagans in the fourth of book of *Historia Nova* regarding the expences of the ceremonies.

"" Theodosius, therefore, told them, that the treasury was too much exhausted by the expence of sacred rites and sacrifices, and that he should, therefore, abolish them, since he neither thought them commendable, nor could the exigencies of the army spare so much money. The Senate in reply observed, that the sacrifices were not duly performed, unless the charges were defrayed from the public funds. Yet thus the laws for the performance of sacred rites and sacrifices were repealed and abolished, besides other institutions and ceremonies, which had been received from their ancestors ""

This is quite an impressive blow to the ancient traditions and although the Stoics, Peripatetics, Epicureans, and many others likewise criticized the flashy festivals and ceremonies, they never really were able to curtail their expenditure that much and force their philosophies on the people. In other words, they did not proselytize. 

Various civilizations and city-states criticized each other for being too decadent, too sensuous, and even too supersititious as we see in **Caesar** Gallic Wars where he criticizes the Gauls and Druids for their uncivilized superstitions in book 6 

Moreover, we also see **Juvenal** rolling his eyes at Roman women for following Chaldean astrologers saying: 

""But even greater faith’s placed in the Chaldeans: whatever the astrologer claims, women will believe to have issued out of Ammon’s oasis, the Oracle at Delphi having fallen silent, and the human race now blind as regards the future.

1639808743,"How can anybody be an admirer of Roman history and like HBO's ""Rome""?","I find it incredible that certain persons in this subreddit still wax poetically about HBO's ""Rome"".  If there were ever a show that mangled Roman history to an incredible level, that was it.  The show was supposed to provide an ""authentic"" experience, at the very least, but it did not even manage this. 

Most of the plot was ridiculous.  Considering that it dealt with a very well-known period of history, it managed to make it unrecognizable.  Julius Caesar is presented like an oversexed fool pursuing a mid-50's lady (Servilia) to the degree that he forgets to pursue the civil war and has to be shamed to finally go after Pompey.  He is also scheming to sell his veterans short.  Nothing of which is even remotely true.  Octavian, a known prude sleeps with his sister; why not try a little incest?  Cleopatra is a perennially doped-up idiot who does not know what is coming or going.  doped-up.  Brutus kills Caesar because his mother, Servilia, put him up for this.  Listen, this stuff could have been the foundation of a great comedy!!

Then one comes to the key characters, Pullo and Vorenus.  Here the plot just goes to typical tropes of two army buddies, as if the Roman army was nothing more than the US military fighting with just swords.  The total experience of soldiers and centurions in the Roman army was absolutely different from any models that one is familiar with.  Nothing can be as inauthentic of Rome as these characters.  For much of the rest of the show, one has the ""Gangs of New York"" translated into a toga-clad script.

Although the show recreated the Roman forum adequately (there were a few discrepancies), much of the rest was not even close to what one would have experienced living in that period.  The most laughable part was the depiction of Alexandria.  Subreddit members here can easily find digital recreations of Alexandria of that period.  What was in the show resembled more Pi Rameses, the capital of Egypt 1200 years earlier.  So much for authenticity.  Everything in Egypt was laughable. 

Some redditors here say that the show creators did not want to film a ""documentary"".  This is laughable.  One can create a very good show while staying close to recorded history.  A great example of this is BBC's  ""I Claudius"".  All the facts are accurate; the motivations are, of course, the creations of the author, Robert Graves.  I am more than sure that Claudius did not designate Nero as his heir because he wanted Britannicus to restore the Republic.  He definitely did, anyway, and he never recorded his motivations regarding this for posterity.  Just parenthetically, after the Messalina coup that he barely survived, he needed a true Julian in the succession to restore confidence in the credentials of the imperial family....but this is another matter.

In conclusion, those who watch Rome get a Julius Caesar who is a parody of the real man, have a totally warped idea of what happened and why, and have not watched anything nearly authentic.  it was really only a toga show of extremely low quality.

The uprising of Spartacus deeply shook Ancient Rome and its slave system. It went down in world history as the largest slave uprising of all time. This uprising hastened the transition of state power in Rome from a republican form of government to an imperial one.

The military organization created by Spartacus turned out to be so strong that it could successfully withstand the elite Roman army for a long time. The image of Spartacus is widely reflected in the world of fiction and art.

1639642530,Story of Spartacus ( continued) Part 3,"In the Spartacus army, there was a split from it, 30 thousand people separated under the command of Crixus. This detachment of rebels (historians to this day argue about their composition – were they Germans or Italians) in the battle of Mount Gargano in Northern Apulia was destroyed by the Romans under the command of the consul Lucius Gellius. If the legionnaires took the rebels prisoner, it was only in order to execute them.

Such a loss greatly weakened the army of Spartacus. However, the leader of the rebellious Roman slaves turned out to be a talented commander. Taking advantage of the disunity of the actions of the advancing armies of the consuls G. Lentula and L. Gellius, he defeated them one by one. A well-organized and trained army of rebel slaves demonstrated their superiority over the Roman legions in every battle.

After two such heavy defeats, the Roman Senate had to draw up troops from distant provinces to Italy hastily. After these two great victories, Spartacus’ army marched along Italy’s Adriatic coast. But even as the Carthaginian commander Hannibal, the leader of the rebellious slaves, did not go to Rome, which was in awe of the real threat of the appearance of a huge army of rebellious slaves and the Italian poor before its walls.

In northern Italy, in the province of Cisalpine Gaul, at the Battle of Mutin (south of the Padus Po) in 72, Spartacus utterly defeated the troops of the proconsul Cassius. From Mutina, the Romans fled to the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is known that Spartacus did not pursue Cassius.

Now the rebellious slaves, who dreamed of finding freedom, were within easy reach of the Alps. Nobody stopped them from crossing the Alps and ending up in Gaul. However, for unknown reasons, the army of the rebels turned back from Mutina and, once again bypassing Rome, went to the South of the Apennine Peninsula, keeping close to the coast of the Adriactic sea

The Roman Senate sent a new army against the rebellious slaves, this time 40,000, under the command of the experienced commander Marcus Licinius Crassus, who came from the equestrian class and was distinguished by cruelty in establishing proper order in the army. He receives under his command six Roman legions and auxiliary troops. Crassus’s legions consisted of experienced, war-hardened soldiers.

In the fall of 72, an army of rebellious slaves concentrated on the Bruttian Peninsula of Italy (present-day province of Calabria). They intended to cross the Strait of Messina to the island of Sicily on the ships of Asia Minor Cilician pirates. Most likely, Spartacus decided to raise slaves to revolt in this, one of the richest provinces of Ancient Rome, which was considered one of his granaries. In addition, the history of this Italian region knew many performances of slaves with weapons in their hands, and Spartacus most likely heard about this.

However, the Cilician pirates, fearing to become blood enemies of the powerful Rome, deceived Spartacus, and their naval fleets did not come to the shores of Bruttia, to the port of Regia. There were no ships in the same port city since the rich Roman townspeople, when the rebels approached, left Rhegium on them. Attempts to cross the Strait of Messina on homemade rafts were unsuccessful.

Meanwhile, the army of Marcus Licinius Crassus went into the rear of the rebellious slaves. The legionaries erected a line of typical Roman fortifications at the narrowest point of the Bruttian Peninsula, which cut off Spartacus’s army from the rest of Italy. A moat was dug from sea to sea (about 55 kilometers long, 4.5 meters wide and deep) and poured into a high bank.",0,story of spartacus continued part in the spartacus army there be a split from it thousand people separate under the command of crixus this detachment of rebel historian to this day argue about their composition be they germans or italians in the battle of mount gargano in northern apulia be destroyed by the romans under the command of the consul lucius gellius if the legionnaire take the rebel prisoner it be only in order to execute them such a loss greatly weaken the army of spartacus however the leader of the rebellious roman slave turn out to be a talented commander taking advantage of the disunity of the action of the advance army of the consul lentula and gellius he defeat them one by one a and train army of rebel slave demonstrate their superiority over the roman legion in every battle after two such heavy defeat the roman senate have to draw up troop from distant province to italy hastily after these two great victory spartacus army march along italy s adriatic coast but even a the carthaginian commander hannibal the leader of the rebellious slave do not go to rome which be in awe of the real threat of the appearance of a huge army of rebellious slave and the italian poor before it wall in northern italy in the province of cisalpine gaul at the battle of mutin south of the padus po in spartacus utterly defeat the troop of the proconsul cassius from mutina the romans flee to the shore of the tyrrhenian sea it be know that spartacus do not pursue cassius now the rebellious slave who dream of find freedom be within easy reach of the alps nobody stop them from cross the alps and end up in gaul however for unknown reason the army of the rebel turn back from mutina and once again bypassing rome go to the south of the apennine peninsula keep close to the coast of the adriactic sea the roman senate sent a new army against the rebellious slave this time under the command of the experienced commander marcus licinius crassus who come from the equestrian class and be distinguish by cruelty in establish proper order in the army he receives under his command six roman legion and auxiliary troop crassus s legion consist of experienced soldier in the fall of an army of rebellious slave concentrate on the bruttian peninsula of italy province of calabria they intend to cross the strait of messina to the island of sicily on the ship of asia minor cilician pirate most likely spartacus decide to raise slave to revolt in this one of the richest province of ancient rome which be consider one of his granary in addition the history of this italian region knew many performance of slave with weapon in their hand and spartacus most likely heard about this however the cilician pirate fear to become blood enemy of the powerful rome deceive spartacus and their naval fleet do not come to the shore of bruttia to the port of regia there be no ship in the same port city since the rich roman townspeople when the rebel approach left rhegium on them attempts to cross the strait of messina on homemade raft be unsuccessful meanwhile the army of marcus licinius crassus go into the rear of the rebellious slave the legionary erect a line of typical roman fortification at the narrow point of the bruttian peninsula which cut off spartacus s army from the rest of italy a moat be dug from sea to sea about kilometer long meter wide and deep and pour into a high bank

1639603654,Story of Spartacus (continued)Part 2,"By the beginning of 73 BC. Spartacus’ detachment quickly grew to 10 thousand people. The ranks of the rebellious gladiators were daily replenished by fugitive slaves, gladiators, the ruined peasants of the Campania province, and defectors from the Roman legions. Spartacus sent out small detachments to the surrounding estates, freeing slaves everywhere and taking away weapons and food from the Romans. Soon the whole Campania, with the exception of the cities protected by strong fortress walls, was in the hands of the rebellious slaves.

Soon Spartacus wins a series of convincing victories over the Roman troops, who were trying to suppress the slave uprising in the bud and destroy its participants. The summit of Vesuvius and the approaches to the extinct volcano became the scene of bloody battles. The Roman historian Sallust wrote about Spartacus of those days that he and his fellow gladiators were ready “to die from iron rather than from hunger.”

In the fall of 72, the army of the praetor Publius Varinius was completely defeated, and he himself was almost captured, which plunged the authorities of Rome into considerable confusion. And before that, the Spartacists utterly defeated the Roman legion under the command of the praetor Clodius, who presumptuously set up his fortified camp right on the only path that led to the summit of Vesuvius.

Then the gladiators weaved a long staircase from the vine and descended along it from the mountain cliff at night. The Roman legion, suddenly attacked from the rear, was defeated.

Spartacus showed excellent organizational skills, turning the army of rebellious slaves into a well-organized army, modeled on the Roman legions. In addition to the infantry, the Spartacus army had cavalry, scouts, messengers, a small baggage train, which did not burden the troops during their marching life.

Weapons and armor were either captured from the Roman troops or made in the camp of the rebels. The training of troops was established, and also according to Roman models. The teachers of slaves and the Italian poor were former gladiators and fugitive legionnaires, who perfectly wielded various weapons and military formation of the Roman legions.

The army of rebellious slaves was distinguished by high morale and discipline. Initially, commanders of all ranks were chosen from among the most experienced and reliable gladiators and then appointed by Spartacus himself. Management of the Spartacus army was built on a democratic basis and consisted of a council of military leaders and a meeting of soldiers. A firm routine was established for camp and marching life.

Almost nothing is known about the other leaders of the powerful slave uprising in ancient Rome. History has preserved only the names of Kirks(Crixus) and Enomai(Oenamus), two, apparently, Germans, who were elected by the rebellious gladiators as assistants to Spartacus, becoming the commanders of his army.

The first victories of the rebellious slaves met with a wide response. From Campania, the uprising spread to the southern regions of Italy – Apulia, Lucania, Bruttia. By the beginning of 72, Spartacus’ army had grown to 60 thousand people, and during the campaign to the South, it reached, according to various sources, the number of 90-120 thousand people.

The Roman Senate was extremely concerned about the extent of the slave revolt. Two armies were sent against Spartacus, led by experienced and famous victories by the generals – the consuls Gnaeus Lentulus and Lucius Gellius. They hoped to succeed by taking advantage of the disagreements that had begun among the rebels.

A significant part of the slaves wanted to escape from Italy through the Alps in order to find freedom and return to their homeland. Among them was Spartacus himself.

1639591352,Story of Spartacus,"Presumably, Spartacus was born in Thrace (modern Bulgaria). Antique authors report conflicting information about his life. According to some sources, he was a prisoner of war, fell into slavery, and was assigned to the gladiatorial school in Capua (City in Italy). According to another version, the Thracian served as a mercenary in the Roman army, then fled and, being captured, was given to the gladiators.

Spartacus was distinguished by physical strength, dexterity, and courage, skillfully wielded weapons. For his abilities, he gained freedom and became a fencing teacher at a gladiatorial school. Spartacus enjoyed great prestige among the gladiators of the Capua school of Lentula Batiak and then among the rebellious slaves of Ancient Rome.

About the physical strength of Spartacus and his mental talents, Plutarch, a Greek philosopher, said that “he was more like an educated Hellene than a barbarian.” “He himself is great in his own strengths of body and soul” – this is how another ancient Roman writer Sallust speaks of the leader of the rebellious slaves.

The greatest slave revolt in the ancient world had the most fertile ground. Wars flooded Italy with slaves of various ethnic groups Gauls, Germans, Thracians, Hellenized inhabitants of Asia and Syria… The bulk of the slaves were employed in agriculture and were in extremely difficult conditions.

Due to their brutal exploitation, the life of the Roman slaves was extremely short-lived. However, this did not particularly disturb the slave owners, since the victorious campaigns of the Roman army ensured an uninterrupted supply of cheap slaves to the slave markets.

Of the city slaves, gladiators were in a special position. Not a single celebration could do without gladiatorial performances in ancient Rome of that era. Well-trained and trained gladiators were released into the arena to kill each other for the joy of thousands of Roman citizens.

There were special schools where physically strong slaves were taught the art of gladiators. One of the most famous schools of gladiators was located in the province of Campania, in the city of Capua.

The uprising of slaves in ancient Rome began with the fact that a group of gladiator slaves (about 70 people) fled from the Capua school after discovering a conspiracy and taking refuge at the summit of Mount Vesuvius.

In total, there were more participants in the conspiracy under the leadership of Spartacus – 200 people, but the guards of the gladiatorial school and the city of Capua defeated the conspirators at the very beginning of their performance. The fugitives have entrenched themselves on the inaccessible mountain peak, turning it into a military camp. Only one narrow path led to it from the valley.",0,story of spartacus presumably spartacus be born in thrace modern bulgaria antique author report conflict information about his life according to some source he be a prisoner of war fell into slavery and be assign to the gladiatorial school in capua city in italy according to another version the thracian serve a a mercenary in the roman army then flee and be capture be give to the gladiator spartacus be distinguish by physical strength dexterity and courage skillfully wield weapon for his ability he gain freedom and become a fence teacher at a gladiatorial school spartacus enjoy great prestige among the gladiator of the capua school of lentula batiak and then among the rebellious slave of ancient rome about the physical strength of spartacus and his mental talent plutarch a greek philosopher say that he be more like an educate hellene than a he himself be great in his own strength of body and soul this be how another ancient roman writer sallust speaks of the leader of the rebellious slave the great slave revolt in the ancient world have the most fertile ground wars flood italy with slave of various ethnic group gauls germans thracians hellenized inhabitant of asia and the bulk of the slave be employ in agriculture and be in extremely difficult condition due to their brutal exploitation the life of the roman slave be extremely however this do not particularly disturb the slave owner since the victorious campaign of the roman army ensure an uninterrupted supply of cheap slave to the slave market of the city slave gladiator be in a special position not a single celebration could do without gladiatorial performance in ancient rome of that era and train gladiator be release into the arena to kill each other for the joy of thousand of roman citizen there be special school where physically strong slave be taught the art of gladiator one of the most famous school of gladiator be locate in the province of campania in the city of capua the uprise of slave in ancient rome begin with the fact that a group of gladiator slave about people flee from the capua school after discover a conspiracy and take refuge at the summit of mount vesuvius in total there be more participant in the conspiracy under the leadership of spartacus people but the guard of the gladiatorial school and the city of capua defeat the conspirator at the very begin of their performance the fugitive have entrench themselves on the inaccessible mountain peak turn it into a military camp only one narrow path lead to it from the valley

1639581650,Why I was hurt reading The Annals by Tacitus,"I spend two years reading Titus Livy and Polybius. Then I moved on chronologically and got to read Sallust Jugurthine War, and Plutarch's biographies. I read Caesar's books on the Gallic Wars and the Civil War. 

It was so wonderful and panoramic. 

Reading about these heroic Romans opening themselves up to the world and charting in new territories. Culminating finally in young Augustus and the annexation of Ptolemaic Egypt. 

Then we move into such a new world that a certain luster is lost. I even felt sad when I reading on the death of old Lepidus. A man who died in such a different Rome than the one he came into. 

It hurts to read Tacitus and feel ourselves in this new chamber with Tiberius and apathetic senators. Maecenas and Agrippa are dead, the rostra lost its splendor, and while there is this threat from the Parthians and Germanic tribes, we find ourselves really in a whole new Rome. So different from that of Cato and Scipio. Even from the one of Marius and Sulla. 

I found myself so inspired by Germanicus, I felt him to be this unique character in this post-Augustan Rome and loved his adventures. 

When he dies and the old man abandons Rome for his island palace; I cannot help but feel a deep pain.",0,why i be hurt reading the annals by tacitus i spend two year reading titus livy and polybius then i move on chronologically and get to read sallust jugurthine war and plutarch biography i read caesar book on the gallic wars and the civil war it be so wonderful and panoramic reading about these heroic romans opening themselves up to the world and chart in new territory culminating finally in young augustus and the annexation of ptolemaic egypt then we move into such a new world that a certain luster be lose i even felt sad when i reading on the death of old lepidus a man who die in such a different rome than the one he come into it hurt to read tacitus and feel ourselves in this new chamber with tiberius and apathetic senator maecenas and agrippa be dead the rostrum lose it splendor and while there be this threat from the parthians and germanic tribe we find ourselves really in a whole new rome so different from that of cato and scipio even from the one of marius and sulla i found myself so inspire by germanicus i felt him to be this unique character in this rome and love his adventure when he dy and the old man abandon rome for his island palace i can not help but feel a deep pain

Their eldest Aunt is a very warm person and has told me to feel free to go to the local boarding building to learn lessons despite not being Romanian or a member of their national Church and she even agreed to do a few private lessons to me because (well I guess its partly because a few time I just helped a few members of the community out of the blue in different situations, though the girl is a pretty warm person herself in an Audrey Hepburn charming sortaway).

So I am gonna go ahead take the offer because I have nothing else to do in my free time and I admit I never took another language before. In fact I was gonna order some Dutch CDs to learn the language my fav celeb Audrey Hepburn but I decided to shelf that plan after receiving the next door neighbor's offer.

So TIL Romanian is a Romance Language. So does that mean knowing it would make French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and a whole other bunch of obscure language I just learned today from across Europe much easier to learn?

In addition reading on Wiki the language has a strong Slavic influence esp in word count. Enough I seen a few Redditors calling if a hybrid of Russian and Italian. So does that mean learning the language would put me a step up in learning Russian and Polish and other Eastern European languages and Balkan tongues such as Serbian?

1639057569,How the pagan gods and traditions were taken less seriously,"It's very interesting to hear Prudentius call the traditional practices of the ancient Romans ""Superstitio veterum avorum"" (superstition of old grandpas) 

When we browse through the pages of Roman history, we see Christianity rising little by little but what we often don't see is how less and less the old gods were taken less and less seriously. 

One of the main things people gloss over is the importance of Alexandria and Antioch. These two cities were not just touristy capitals but extremely important centers of learning. Alexandria prided itself on being the child of Alexander the Great and Antioch prided itself on being the child of Antiochus the Great. 

Athens, Corinth, and Thebes were cute. Nobody really cared about them that much. When we look at the works of gentlemen like Dio Chrysostom and Lactantius. The former of which says of prostitution 

*""if old customs and diseases that have become entrenched in the course of time fall to the care of our ruler, he shall by no means leave them without attention and correction, but, with an eye to what is practicable, he shall curb and correct them in some way or other.""* (Euboean Discourse) 

We see how the more learned men are beginning to question things that were so common in people's lives and which would eventually diffuse into Christian teachings. By the 2nd century, Seneca and Cicero were considered classics, and their more rational philosophy impacted these orators.

Lactantius in his *Institutiones Divinaes* chastises old men who are obsessed with incense and calls the worshippers of Venus as people who make ""dolls"" for her. 

""*men offer to these dolls, which are of large size, and adorned as though for the stage, both perfumes,* *incense**, and odors: they* *sacrifice* *to these \[dolls\] costly and fattened victims, which have a mouth, but one that is not suitable for eating; to these, they bring robes and costly garments, though they have no need of clothing; to these, they dedicate gold and silver, of which they who receive them are as destitute as they who have given them.*"" (Divine Institutions)

In many ways, these late Roman orators and Christian writers criticize the old pagan traditions as the French philosophes criticize holy water, iconography, the wine blood of Christ, geocentrism, and other church teachings. They looked at it and said ""These things are very silly and ridiculous"" 

Hence, why Prudentius calls it the superstition of old grandpas. It doesn't hold much weight in a cosmopolitan multi-continental empire where the dominant language is Greek and Latin. 

But in that old world of Carthaginians, Persians, naked Gauls, etc... it is very normal.  

Claudius Pulcher was villanized for throwing the sacred chickens in the sea during the 2nd century BC, but in the 2nd century AD, many people see it as a cute little story that's not meant to be taken seriously. The old Punic war becomes mythologized and it's quite interesting how by the imperial period, practically all of pre-Caesarian Rome is already referred to as *αρχαίος* (Greek for 'archaic') or in Latin, antiqua. 

Anthony and Cleopatra is mythologized, Hannibal, Mithridates, etc... people no longer take the old religious traditions seriously. They ask themselves

What's the point of digging up a pig's intestines? What's the point of lavishing perfume and purple clothes on a life-size doll of Venus and Minerva? Hence, these things, throughout the decades, become more and more unpopular, especially around the time of the Cyprian plague and third-century crisis, when showering gifts on statues during a time of immense poverty was seen as an insult.",0,how the pagan god and tradition be take less seriously it very interest to hear prudentius call the traditional practice of the ancient romans superstitio veterum avorum superstition of old grandpa when we browse through the page of roman history we see christianity rise little by little but what we often do see be how less and less the old god be take less and less seriously one of the main thing people gloss over be the importance of alexandria and antioch these two city be not just touristy capital but extremely important center of learn alexandria pride itself on be the child of alexander the great and antioch pride itself on be the child of antiochus the great athens corinth and thebes be cute nobody really care about them that much when we look at the work of gentleman like dio chrysostom and lactantius the former of which say of prostitution if old custom and disease that have become entrench in the course of time fall to the care of our ruler he shall by no mean leave them without attention and correction but with an eye to what be practicable he shall curb and correct them in some way or other euboean discourse we see how the more learn men be begin to question thing that be so common in people life and which would eventually diffuse into christian teaching by the century seneca and cicero be consider classic and their more rational philosophy impact these orator lactantius in his institutiones divinaes chastises old men who be obsess with incense and call the worshipper of venus a people who make doll for her men offer to these doll which be of large size and adorn a though for the stage both perfume incense and odor they sacrifice to these costly and fatten victim which have a mouth but one that be not suitable for eat to these they bring robe and costly garment though they have no need of clothing to these they dedicate gold and silver of which they who receive them be a destitute a they who have give them divine institutions in many way these late roman orator and christian writer criticize the old pagan tradition a the french philosophes criticize holy water iconography the wine blood of christ geocentrism and other church teaching they look at it and say these thing be very silly and ridiculous hence why prudentius call it the superstition of old grandpa it do hold much weight in a cosmopolitan empire where the dominant language be greek and latin but in that old world of carthaginians persians naked gauls etc it be very normal claudius pulcher be villanized for throw the sacred chicken in the sea during the century bc but in the century ad many people see it a a cute little story that not meant to be take seriously the old punic war becomes mythologize and it quite interest how by the imperial period practically all of rome be already refer to a αρχαίος greek for or in latin antiqua anthony and cleopatra be mythologize hannibal mithridates etc people no longer take the old religious tradition seriously they ask themselves what the point of dig up a pig intestine what the point of lavish perfume and purple clothes on a doll of venus and minerva hence these thing throughout the decade become more and more unpopular especially around the time of the cyprian plague and crisis when shower gift on statue during a time of immense poverty be see a an insult

Really been enjoying it.

One thing I don't understand however:  For many hundreds of years, over and over again the Roman Army, under the command of various generals or emperors went to war with various barbarian tribes.  They keep on saying that the Roman battle formations/tactics were not well suited for fighting in the forests. In the open field the Roman army was unstoppable but in the forests their disciplined lines weren't easily maintained and they were disadvantaged.  I can understand this, and for the first several encounters over a couple decades, perhaps, this makes sense. But how after many centuries of engagements could they not have developed new tactics to fight the barbarians more efficiently?  Or did they, and the documentary is kinda dropping the ball on this one?

Egypt and Seleucia were no longer scary in the first century BC. Yet I would figure they would at least take some part in the war against Mithridates. Why were they chilling? 

Bithynia and Pergamon are gone. Both have been bequeathed to Rome. But what about Galatia? What were they up to? 

Surely Egypt would try to at least play a role in the east by trying to fight Tigranes and sharing the spoils with Rome, but they didn't do this at all. It's quite surprising since they had such a keen hatred for the Seleucids. 

Speaking of Seleucia, this is the war that they finally die. In the third Mithridatic war, they get annexed by Armenia and then eventually by Rome. But certainly, they could have tried to pick themselves up during that first war with Sulla, right? Why were they so pathetic in this period?

When we look back at the beginning of the 2nd century BC, Seleucia and Egypt had Antiochus III and Ptolemy Epiphanes. If I know these guys, they would have DEFINITELY gotten involved in a war between Rome and the kingdom of Pontus. Especially since at that time, Pontus had the arrogant Pharnaces I.",0,how come seleucia galatia and egypt be chill during the mithridatic war it an interest thing but let take a look at what be go on egypt and seleucia be no longer scary in the first century bc yet i would figure they would at least take some part in the war against mithridates why be they chill bithynia and pergamon be go both have be bequeath to rome but what about galatia what be they up to surely egypt would try to at least play a role in the east by try to fight tigranes and share the spoil with rome but they do do this at all it quite surprising since they have such a keen hatred for the seleucids speaking of seleucia this be the war that they finally die in the third mithridatic war they get annexed by armenia and then eventually by rome but certainly they could have try to pick themselves up during that first war with sulla right why be they so pathetic in this period when we look back at the begin of the century bc seleucia and egypt have antiochus iii and ptolemy epiphanes if i know these guy they would have definitely gotten involve in a war between rome and the kingdom of pontus especially since at that time pontus have the arrogant pharnaces i

1638110302,Did Nero really kill his wife? Here's what you need to know,"We all know the infamous story of Nero killing his pregnant wife by a kick in the belly.  


&gt;He dearly loved Poppaea, whom he married twelve days after his divorce from Octavia, yet he caused her death too by kicking her when she was pregnant and ill, because she had scolded him for coming home late from the races.  
&gt;  
&gt;– Seutonius, *Nero 35.3*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Sabina also perished at this time through an act of Nero's; either accidentally or intentionally he had leaped upon her with his feet while she was pregnant.  
&gt;  
&gt;– Cassius Dio, *Epitome of Book LXII.27.4*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;After the close of the festival, Poppaea met her end through a chance outburst of anger on the part of her husband, who felled her with a kick during pregnancy.   
&gt;  
&gt;– Tacitus, *Annals XVI.6.1*

Tacitus further adds that some writers claimed Nero poisoned her, though he does not believe them.

&gt;That poison played its part I am unable to believe, though the assertion is made by some writers less from conviction than from hatred; for Nero was desirous of children, and love for his wife was a ruling passion.   
&gt;  
&gt;– Tacitus, *Annals XVI.6.1*

Many people do not know that apart from Nero, Persian King **Cambyses II** (Son of Cyrus the Great), **Periander** (Second Tyrant of the Cypselid dynasty that ruled over ancient Corinth) and **Herodes Atticus** (Athenian sophist and teacher of young **Marcus Aurelius**) have been attributed to have killed their pregnant wives by a kick in the belly during pregnancy. Cambyses and Periander killed their pregnant wife in the same manner as Nero, whereas Herodes was accused by his brother-in-law of having his freedman kick his pregnant wife in the belly but was later exonerated by Aurelius.  


&gt;But the Egyptian tale is that as the two sat at table the woman took a lettuce and plucked off the leaves, then asked her husband whether he \[Cambyses\] liked the look of it, with or without leaves; ""With the leaves,"" said he; whereupon she answered: ""Yet you have stripped Cyrus' house as bare as this lettuce."" Angered at this, they say, he leaped upon her, she being great with child; and she died of the hurt he gave her.  
&gt;  
&gt;– Herodotus, *Histories 3.32.4*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;By her \[Lysida\] he \[Periander\] had two sons, Cypselus and Lycophron, the younger a man of intelligence, the elder weak in mind. However, after some time, in a fit of anger, he killed his wife by throwing a footstool at her, or by a kick, when she was pregnant, having been egged on by the slanderous tales of concubines, whom he afterwards burnt alive.  
&gt;  
&gt;– Diogenes Laertius, *Lives of Eminent Philosophers Book I.7*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But among the eminently philosophic actions of Marcus we must include his behaviour in this trial. For he never frowned or changed his expression, as might have happened even to an umpire, but he turned to the Athenians and said: Make your defence, Athenians, even though Herodes does not give you leave. And as he listened to the speeches in defence he was greatly pained, though without showing it, by many things that he heard. But when the decree of the Athenian assembly was recited to him, in which they openly attacked Herodes for trying to corrupt the magistrates of Greece with the honeyed strains of his eloquence, and when they exclaimed: Alas, what bitter honey! and again, Happy they who perished in the plague! his feelings were so profoundly affected by what he heard that he burst into tears without concealment. But since the Athenian defence contained an indictment not of Herodes only but also of his freedmen, Marcus turned his anger against the freedmen, employing a punishment which was as mild as possible; for by this phrase he himself describes his judgement. Only in the case of Alcimedon he remitted the penalty, saying that the loss of his children was enough. Thus did Marcus conduct this affair in a manner worthy of a philosopher.  
&gt;  
&gt;– Philostratus, *Lives of the Sophists 2.1.8* \[Trial of Herodes**\]**

There is no doubt that Nero truly loved his second wife Poppaea Augusta Sabina. He wrote several poems dedicated to her of which only some are extant.

&gt;After a fight or chariot race,  
my head dissolving in your lap  
I lie and gaze up at your face.  
&gt;  
&gt;In crowds you subtly lean, hands twine…  
Some nights your lust is fierce and sudden.  
Rotten with wine, your thighs ride mine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Each glance, each kiss is contraband.  
“Fancy it's you again,” we laugh  
and every night's a one-night-stand.  
&gt;  
&gt;– *Epithalamium (trans. Geoffrey Lehmann)*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Wearing Augustus's sun-hat  
amongst our courtyard plants I sit  
and eat and drink with you, Poppaea.  
Together we grow old and fat.  
&gt;  
&gt;– *Love Lyric (trans. Geoffrey Lehmann)*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;At night I wear your dresses in our bed  
and howl. Each day  
your perfume in the room is weaker.  
I'll go to Greece, never come back.  
&gt;  
&gt;– *Elegy for Poppaea (trans. Geoffrey Lehmann)*

The second poem may have been written after Poppaea’s death. Nero supposedly burned a year's worth of Arabia's incense production at her funeral.

&gt;Her good fortune has been caused by the luxury of mankind even in the hour of death, when they burn over the departed the products which they had originally understood to have been created for the gods. Good authorities declare that Arabia does not produce so large a quantity of perfume in a year's output as was burned by the Emperor Nero in a day at the obsequies of his consort Poppaea.  
&gt;  
&gt;– Pliny the Elder, *Natural History 12.41.1*

As stated by Vasily Rudich in *Political dissidence under Nero*, we must keep in mind Suetonius's, Tacitus's, and Cassius Dio's severe biases against Nero and the impossibility of their knowing private events, and hence recognize that Poppaea may have died due to fatal complications of miscarriage or childbirth which was common during that time. 

This was my attempt to do a critical analysis of the Uxoricide accusation. ""Nero kicked his pregnant wife by kicking"" is usually one of the first things to be commented when speaking about Nero. Did Nero really commit Uxoricide or was he the victim of character assassination by later historians based on a historical pattern of powerful men playing football with their pregnant wives? I happen to believe the latter.",0,did nero really kill his wife here what you need to know we all know the infamous story of nero kill his pregnant wife by a kick in the belly gt he dearly love

The last notable/ remarkable Roman writer/ philosopher was Marcus Aurelius who died in 180 A.D. 

After that barring some major Christian theologians there wasn’t much in the way of “ classic” Roman literature or Philosophy.

More to the point , I think somewhere around 200-250 Rome stops being “ fun” to read about or learn about.

From that point on it just seems to be a lot of civil war and plotting with little in the way of “ Roman Rome” if that makes sense.

Around 20-30 years before the sack of Rome, the Roman empire just seems to be this decrepit dying, corrupt midieval kingdom rather than the “ Mighty Rome!” Of Caesar, Mark Anthony and Cicero.

Is this a correct perception? Who are the main poets, philosophers from maybe 275 AD to 476 AD?",0,poet of late antiquity this may just be my perception but it seem the best roman exist from around bc to maybe cato seneca cicero virgil julius caesar etc etc all seem to be from this period the last remarkable roman philosopher be marcus aurelius who die in after that bar some major christian theologian there wasn t much in the way of classic roman literature or philosophy more to the point i think somewhere around rome stop be fun to read about or learn about from that point on it just seem to be a lot of civil war and plot with little in the way of roman rome if that make sense around year before the sack of rome the roman empire just seem to be this decrepit die corrupt midieval kingdom rather than the mighty rome of caesar mark anthony and cicero is this a correct perception who be the main poet philosopher from maybe ad to ad

My question is; what determines the name given to the Legion? Is it determined by where the legion was recruited or where it was stationed, or is there some other basis for it?

This was made all the more confusing by the fact that multiple versions of the same name existed (e.g. ""Legio I Italica"" through to ""Legio V Italica""), which I took to mean that Legio V Italica was the fifth Legion raised in Italy - but I was unsure so I thought I'd ask, especially considering that the Italic Legions I've seen during research appear to have been stationed somewhat far from Italy (e.g. I Italica in Bulgaria) and some legions don't appear to have names related to places at all (e.g. ""II Augusta"" or ""VI Victrix"").

Dr. Friedman discovered that a room in the building, originally designated for naval affairs but now a commissioned Senate room, was inspired by Pompeiian murals, the House of the Ship. 

I found the lecture to be fascinating and thought it was a cool connection between Rome (Pompeii) and the United States. I know many easily discern the influence of Roman architecture within Washington D.C. (such as the Jefferson Memorial and the Pantheon) however, I found it quite interesting to see a direct connection between Pompeiian murals and the murals inside of the U.S. Capital building. 

I’ve linked an article by Dr. Friedman which explains her research and goes into depth about the connection.

I've got a question for the experts.

In 'The Truth about Velleius Paterculus: Prologomena' written by G. V. Summer  
( [https://www.jstor.org/stable/311010](https://www.jstor.org/stable/311010) )

On page 269 he states a text: ""Of the true sentiments of the Senate and People when the Claudian returned to power, no testimony exists""   
footnote about the quote:  ""Syme, Rom. Rev. 431, with n. 2, citing Velleius 2.103.5 so as to make  manifest the author's inanity""

But when I go to book 2, 103, 5 it states another text.   
I can't seem to find where Velleius would have said the line ""...no testimony exists"".

The author makes of it that he made the testimony up, whereas I interpret it as ""there are no words to describe"". But I would like to check it with the original text, that I cannot find.

Does anyone, by chance, know where to find it or how the author came by the quote?

1637318436,"What do you think about Julius Caesar being a meditation deity (God) in Tibet for the last 1,200 years?","Since about 740AD there has been an increasingly embellished legend in Tibet/Mongolia, about a man named Fromo Kesar (Roman Caeser) or Great King Gesar. This Kesar (Julius Caeser) is also a diety/god (meant for use in visualization meditation). I wonder what Caeser would think if he knew that some people see him as a literal God (for more then a thousand years)?

The story of Kesar is probably based on the life of Julius Caeser given similarities to events in his life. For example: Kesar has a wise uncle that is the a leader in Ling (Ling means island/peninsula in Tibetan) who trains/reforms the military \[*Gaius Marius, Caesers uncle*\]. Kesars uncle has a greedy &amp; cowardly rival \[*Sulla*\] that gets Kesar stripped of his titles and banishes him \[*Sulla stripping Caeser of his priestly titles and forced him to go into hiding*\]. When Kesar is banished he ends up with (or captured by) wild men that he’s rude to/taunts, later kills them \[*Caeser &amp; the pirates?*\]. Later Kesar wins 30 battles, including a massive siege, against the “barbarian borderlands to the North"" \[*Guals*\]. Then he meets the queen of a neighboring country and falls in love \[*Cleopatra*\]. His wife is kidnapped (carried on a rug) by another king, and Kesar burns his palace \[*library of Alexandria*\]. Later demons in the disguise of his closest friends/monk advisers stab him to death (taken out in later versions). “Kesar” becomes a title/name for the Kings of Ling (Caeser was an Imperial title).

1637063004,Important cultural developments to consider in the 2nd century AD,"Theres this bias that many people have, a presumption really, that past centuries were really nothing more than just the same period in terms of culture and traditions. We look at the 1980s as being radically different from the 1930s and this has some great truth to it. But for the Romans, this was likewise the case. 

&amp;#x200B;

The 2nd century, or the age of Antonines, definitely had a continuous development of culture, ideas, and traditions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lets briefly just look at the 180s and compare them to the earlier part of the century. 

&amp;#x200B;

The former was the reign of Commodus, the latter the reign of Nerva/Trajan/Hadrian.

&amp;#x200B;

People in the 180s for one had more tolerance for Mithraists and followers of Serapis. You couldnt just kill a slave without a trial at court. There was also much more to see and travel to beyond Italy, Antioch was becoming more and more popular. The works left by Hadrian and Trajan greatly enriched the empire, the Ulpian library, now decades old, had provided a fountain of knowledge to the Roman people. Emperor Commodus threw lavish games and in the eyes of many people, this was Rome at its apex. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was more appreciation for science, Pliny had become a household name and there was also Galen and Cleomedes. The works of Celsus was gaining popularity, Christianity had become more mainstream and yet it was only one of the many religions in the whirlpool of different religions and philosophies. Art was saturated, more mosaics, more frescoes, and it was something that made its way more and more into the far flung regions of the empire. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the early 2nd century, in the old Nerva/Trajan period, people were really beginning to grow and prosper after those stable but static years of Domitian. This is that great age of Pliny, Suetonius, Tacitus, Plutarch, and architects like Apollodorus. Trajan's market comes in, the Pantheon gets rebuilt. The 110s and 120s are that period where you start seeing a real decline in farming as Egypt and Africa provides mass food imports. This is Rome really growing and becoming more cosmopolitan and sophisticated. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is why by the 180s, people already live in such a different empire than their forefathers. But they also have to deal with the plague, more factious groups, the debasement of the consulship, a wider diaspora of people, more urban violence, long bread lines, etc... 

&amp;#x200B;

By the end of 2nd century you had a generation of people who were too young to see or remember that post-Domitian boom; the great reigns of Nerva, Trajan and Hadrian. 

&amp;#x200B;

You only have to look at somebody like Lucius Verus, somebody who did not really remember the age of Hadrian and was not alive during Trajans time, to see what the generation that grew up in the great tranquil period of Antoninus was like. 

&amp;#x200B;

We often forget that the period of Marcus Aurelius and Verus was the most unstable out of the five good emperors and that Verus himself had many problems. 

&amp;#x200B;

So by the time somebody like Commodus comes in and we are in the late 2nd century, we have a generation of people that dont remember the great conquest of Dacia, Trajans Parthian campaign, or a Rome that was more agricultural, less diverse, less urban, in other words more \_flavian\_. 

&amp;#x200B;

By the late second century, the Flavians were history and a tale of old Rome. There was no more Chatti and Cherusci to fear. It would be just as ridiculous as if the people from the Gracchi time were to fear the Boii and the Senones.

If anything, we should treat the second century with more careful analysis to see how the empire transitioned in this important period. It is Rome's great transition from the height of the empire to the growing problems of the late empire",0,important cultural development to consider in the century ad theres this bias that many people have a presumption really that past century be really nothing more than just the same period in term of culture and tradition we look at the a be radically different from the and this have some great truth to it but for the romans this be likewise the case amp the century or the age of antonines definitely have a continuous development of culture idea and tradition amp lets briefly just look at the and compare them to the earlier part of the century amp the former be the reign of commodus the latter the reign of amp people in the for one have more tolerance for mithraists and follower of serapis you couldnt just kill a slave without a trial at court there be also much more to see and travel to beyond italy antioch be become more and more popular the work left by hadrian and trajan greatly enrich the empire the ulpian library now decade old have provide a fountain of knowledge to the roman people emperor commodus threw lavish game and in the eye of many people this be rome at it apex amp there be more appreciation for science pliny have become a household name and there be also galen and cleomedes the work of celsus be gain popularity christianity have become more mainstream and yet it be only one of the many religion in the whirlpool of different religion and philosophy art be saturate more mosaic more fresco and it be something that make it way more and more into the far flung region of the empire amp in the early century in the old period people be really begin to grow and prosper after those stable but static year of domitian this be that great age of pliny suetonius tacitus plutarch and architect like apollodorus trajan market come in the pantheon get rebuilt the and be that period where you start see a real decline in farm a egypt and africa provide mass food import this be rome really grow and become more cosmopolitan and sophisticated amp this be why by the people already live in such a different empire than their forefather but they also have to deal with the plague more factious group the debasement of the consulship a wider diaspora of people more urban violence long bread line etc amp by the end of century you have a generation of people who be too young to see or remember that boom the great reign of nerva trajan and hadrian amp you only have to look at somebody like lucius verus somebody who do not really remember the age of hadrian and be not alive during trajans time to see what the generation that grow up in the great tranquil period of antoninus be like amp we often forget that the period of marcus aurelius and verus be the most unstable out of the five good emperor and that verus himself have many problem amp so by the time somebody like commodus come in and we be in the late century we have a generation of people that dont remember the great conquest of dacia trajans parthian campaign or a rome that be more agricultural less diverse less urban in other word more amp by the late second century the flavians be history and a tale of old rome there be no more chatti and cherusci to fear it would be just a ridiculous a if the people from the gracchi time be to fear the boii and the senones amp if anything we should treat the second century with more careful analysis to see how the empire transition in this important period it be rome great transition from the height of the empire to the grow problem of the late empire

1636741204,Is Cicero worth reading?,"I recently saw a new book in the philosophy section of my local book store. It was a copy of a book that was said to be written by Cicero. Not exactly a book per se, but a collection of personal letters and writings that he wrote throughout his life.

I'm interested in reading something by Cicero, but I'm also a little skeptical on how good of a writer he really was. 

I've always read that Cicero wasn't the best roman leader. I read that although he was a great orator, he was also an irresponsible governor, a laughable general and wasn't much of a scholar. I've always felt that the only reason Cicero is so we'll remembered is because he just so happened to be a powerful and wealthy politician during a particularly turbulent and important time in roman history.
However I don't really think he had any actual merit of his own. He was just born into wealth and power and happened to be an outside commentator to the works of actual important figures like Pompey or Augustus.

1636640776,Voltaire's comment on Odoacer and Genseric's invasion,"Voltaire has a very interesting comment in his Philosophical Dictionary which goes as follows 

""Do you really and truly believe that the Herulian Odo, surnamed Acer by the Romans, and known to us by the name of Odoacer, had only Herulians in his train, and that Genseric conducted Vandals alone into Africa? All the wretches without talent or profession, who have nothing to lose, do they not always  join the first captain of robbers who raises the standard of destruction?""

It's an interesting statement and it really made me consider how exactly the Ostrogoths and Vandals were really able to take down Italy and Africa. 

Surely, the ""wretches"" who had nothing to lose would fear the approaching Goths and Vandals. 

But at the same time we are reminded that these people were Christians and also ""Foederati"" so this is where the lines get a little blurry for me. 

The people of the empire didn't see these groups the same way they once saw the Cimbri descending down on them or perhaps the Huns who they saw as infinitely more savage. 

We know Odoacer by the name ""Flavius Odoacer"" but this is a very Latin name. Historian JB Bury also says the following 

""Orestes was killed at Placentia along with his brother Paulus outside Ravenna. The Germanic *foederati,* the Scirians, and the Heruli, as well as a large segment of the Italic Roman army, then proclaimed Odoacer ""Rex Italiae"" 

Now clearly, if Odoacer and his men had imperial ambitions, they would hail him as ""Augustus"" but this wasn't the case. Why not? Wouldn't it be more impressive to have that title rather than king of Italy? And what's with the Roman legions backing Odoacer in the first place? 

How disorganized was this empire by the mid 5th century?",0,voltaire comment on odoacer and genseric invasion voltaire have a very interest comment in his philosophical dictionary which go a follow do you really and truly believe that the herulian odo surnamed acer by the romans and know to u by the name of odoacer have only herulians in his train and that genseric conduct vandals alone into africa all the wretch without talent or profession who have nothing to lose do they not always join the first captain of robber who raise the standard of destruction it an interest statement and it really make me consider how exactly the ostrogoths and vandals be really able to take down italy and africa surely the wretch who have nothing to lose would fear the approach goths and vandals but at the same time we be remind that these people be christians and also foederati so this be where the line get a little blurry for me the people of the empire do see these group the same way they once saw the cimbri descend down on them or perhaps the huns who they saw a infinitely more savage we know odoacer by the name flavius odoacer but this be a very latin name historian jb bury also say the follow orestes be kill at placentia along with his brother paulus outside ravenna the germanic foederati the scirians and the heruli a well a a large segment of the italic roman army then proclaim odoacer rex italiae now clearly if odoacer and his men have imperial ambition they would hail him a augustus but this be the case why not would it be more impressive to have that title rather than king of italy and what with the roman legion backing odoacer in the first place how disorganize be this empire by the mid century

OP: *“\[Romans\] Doesn’t even know what a boat is.”*

Commenter*: “The Romans had great navies. Look at the Punic wars. Look at Pompei ridding the Mediterranean of pirates.""*

I understand the comment and so written a reply on what OP meant by that statement. Many people are unaware of the fact that 3rd Century BC Rome was highly asymmetric in her's land-based and sea-based military capabilities. Here, I have expanded upon my initial reply to tell this very interesting story on how Rome solved her asymmetry problem.

Many people may not be aware of the fact that in the 3rd Century BC Rome didn't have any real naval presence and Carthage's navy dominated the Mediterranean. Before the First Punic War (264–241 BC) , the Roman Republic had not campaigned outside the Italian Peninsula. The First Punic War was in essence *UFC1 - Control of the Mediterranean.*

# TL;DR

In 265 BC, the disastrous misunderstandings at [*Messana*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Messana) initiates the First Punic War. In 264 BC, Rome's direct run at Carthage ends in disaster. In 260 BC, [Appius Claudius Pulcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Claudius_Pulcher_(consul_249_BC)) (Consul 249 BC) tries to invent a Roman navy from scratch. A string of victories follow after [Gaius Duilius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Duilius) (Consul 260 BC) invents the [*Corvus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvus_(boarding_device)) fleet in 261 BC, however storms kill tens of thousands. In 241 BC, [Gaius Lutatius Catulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Lutatius_Catulus) (Consul 242 BC), a Roman admiral, finally knows how to sail. Rome is victorious at the [Aegates Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Aegates). Carthage buys its way out of the war.

# Summary

The war in Sicily reached a stalemate, as the Carthaginians focused on defending their well-fortified towns and cities; these were mostly on the coast and so could be supplied and reinforced with the Romans unable to use their superior army to interdict. The focus of the war shifted to the sea, where the Romans had little experience; on the few occasions they had previously felt the need for a naval presence they had usually relied on small squadrons provided by their Latin or Greek allies.

Rather than accept Greek-Italian help building a fleet, Pulcher’s forces:

\- captured a few Carthaginian ships and had Roman carpenters study them, once pulled onto the beach

\- built replicas as volunteer Italians practiced rowing on benches (nearby on the beach)

\- sailed to catch the Carthaginians operating on Sicily’s north coast to achieve surprise

\- won the first morning’s assault but lost the campaign (and the ships began sinking).

The Romans built 120 warships and dispatched them to Sicily in 260 BC for their crews to carry out basic training. [Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnaeus_Cornelius_Scipio_Asina)'s (Senior Consul, 260 BC) expedition to the [Lipari Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Lipari_Islands) ends in disaster and was captured by the Carthaginians.

Consul Gaius Duilius took over command of fleet operations and began winning within a year because of the clever invention - *Corvus* 

\- which used the same Roman farm carpentry skills and intuition

\- which did not require fresh training

\- which used conventional Roman infantry

After the pain of the war against Pyrrhus (which had just ended) their pride seems to have insisted on ""do it yourself"" approaches.

*In Chapters 1.22-4-11 of his History, Polybius describes this device as a bridge 1.2 m (4 ft) wide and 10.9 m (36 ft) long, with a small parapet on both sides. The engine was probably used in the prow of the ship, where a pole and a system of pulleys allowed the bridge to be raised and lowered. There was a heavy spike shaped like a bird's beak on the underside of the device, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship's deck when the boarding bridge was lowered. This allowed a firm grip between the vessels and a route for the Roman legionaries (who serve as specialized naval infantry called marinus) to cross onto and capture the enemy ship. - Wikipedia*

Gaius Duilius actively encouraged the Carthaginian ships to attack his Corvus fleet. He sailed his leaking vessels right up to Carthaginian formations, harassing the deck archers but maneuvering clumsily until they moved to ram his ships. Using Corvus, he stormed his Roman land fighters onto the other ship, the ship he preferred, at which point the usual lesson learned from his tactics is that he turned a sea battle into a land battle which Romans could win. The Romans' application of boarding tactics worked by winning several battles, most notably those of [Mylae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mylae), [Sulci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sulci), [Tyndaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tyndaris) and [Ecnomus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ecnomus).  
In the [Battle of Mylae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mylae), Duilius captured several enemy vessels, including [Hannibal Gisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Gisco)’s flagship, and was thus the first Roman successful in a naval engagement.

But the win at the Battle of Ecnomus created a disaster. Sailors still unfamiliar with the Mediterranean winds took the invasion fleet southwestward toward Africa, running into winter gales from the northwest. The Corvus bridges caught the wind, the fleet rolled and sank killing perhaps 40,000. Followed by another 10-20,000 lost reserved that were committed to find the first lost fleet. Roman politics dissolved into demonstrations, protests, and religious panic. 

In 240 BC, Rome finally got an ""Admiral"" who learned to sail. He was *C. Lutatius Catulus.* Catulus replaced the corvus bridge with the harpax ballistae (bolt-throwers) mounted down the sides of the ships. Corvus is not mentioned in period sources after the Battle of Ecnomus.

But a decade of anxiety and clumsy sieges around the rim of Sicily had passed, and another storm took perhaps another 6-10,000 lives. Finally, at the Battle of the Aegates Islands (241 BC), not only did the harpax corvus work, but Catulus – spotting bad weather – stowed all his ships’ masts and maneuvered into position stealthily by oar. Carthage was defeated by seamanship and bought its way out of the war within months.

1635709274,Some thoughts on Hadrian.,"\-Hadrian had to pull out of the middle east because the empire was overextended beyond the reasonable limits placed by Augustus. ""mo land mo problems""

\-There were revolts in the rear (Kitos war)

\-Parthians were recovering strength and the campaign would only be more difficult going forward

\-Trajan did not plan for the empire past his death, good thing Plotina picked the capable Hadrian while Trajan lay dead. Hadrian and Plotina both believed in promoting Greek culture. 

\-Hadrian had to execute the few senators/generals he did to avoid civil war that would undo all Trajan and Nerva accomplished in settling the empire and senate

\-Trajan babied the senate and provided the generals with lots of glory and work. Hadrian threatened their livelihood/prestige/auctoritas with the withdrawal so they became angry

\-Post hence these executions he increased the senates rights and privileges trying his best to appease

\-Hadrian creates ""permanent"" borders along Augustan lines (plus Dacia and Brittania) and makes peace with Parthia while granting independent to Armenia

\-Hadrian shows himself as a humanist emperor. Promoting culture around the empire, cancelling public debt, banned worst forms of torture, provided slaves more rights, gave the soldiers and their families more rights (marriage while on duty, illegitimate children can inherit)

\-Hadrian appeared to truly care about the average person in the empire, not just himself, the senate, of the city of Rome itself. He travelled extensively and addressed all problems, big or small, that he reasonably could to the best of his ability

\-No expansionist wars, cancelling debt, and providing jobs via large infrastructure and building projects created wealth. It also provides us with many of the ruins we see today. Hadrian was the greatest builder in Rome's history

\-Hadrian was his own architect. Designing the Pantheon, and his mausoleum now known as Cast St Angelo. 

\-He believed in a cohesive and co-operating Mediterranean empire with Greco-Roman culture as the leading force for improving civilization for the lot of the population. He recognized the disparate population of the empire

\-Jewish revolt in 132 was a complete rejection of his ideal of empire. Jewish people would continue to be a thorn in the cohesiveness he was trying to build in the Mediterranean. He reacted very harshly to delete this perceived threat for the future (I am NOT advocating just explaining his possible thought process) 

\-His attempts at unity point to his belief in a share Mediterranean culture. His obsession especially with Greece is shown in his architecture and religious practice. Even so far as creating a mini-Greece in Tivoli and joining in the Eleusinian Mysteries 

\-He was IN LOVE with Antinous, he was a tourist, he was a art collector, a poet, and idealist, and a clear thinking military strategist.

\-Then he was a grief stricken lover, depressed and suicidal, defeatist and no longer as motivated.

1635696335,Quintillian fuming about the culture and practices of his day,"Quintillian lived in the first century AD and flourished under the Flavian dynasty, his iconic work *Instituto Oratoria*, on the institution of oratory, is one of the greatest works of ancient Rome and he goes into a great deal on his advice for what is good oratory and how it should operate in society. He does give his strong opinions about the current culture and practices of his day, here are some of those passages below.

From *Instituto Oratoria* 

**On Education and Teachers**

""I strongly disapprove of the prevailing practice of allowing boys to stand up or leap from the seats in the expression of their applause. Young men, even when they are listening to others, should be temperate in manifesting their approval."" 

""But in the schools of today we see boys stooping forward ready to spring to their feet: at the close of each period they not merely rise, but rush forward with shouts of unseemly enthusiasm.""

""The actual practice of declamation has degenerated to such an extent owing to the fault of our teachers, that it has come to be one of the chief causes of the corruption of modern oratory; such is the extravagance and ignorance of our declaimers""

""But any of these faults are tolerable compared with the practice of chanting instead of speaking, which is the worst feature of our modern oratory, whether in the courts or in the schools and of which I can only say that I do not know whether it is more useless or more repugnant to good taste""

**On Music**

""I think I ought to be more emphatic than I have been in stating that the music which I desire to see taught is not our modern music, which has been emasculated by the lascivious melodies of our effeminate stage and has to no small extent destroyed such manly vigor as we still possessed. No, I refer to the music of old which was employed to sing the praises of brave men and was sung by the brave themselves.""

**On Theater and Philosophy**

""The vocabulary of the tragedians is full of dignity, while in that of the comedians there is a certain elegance and Attic grace. They are, too, more careful about dramatic structure than the majority of moderns, who regard epigram as the sole merit of every kind of literary work. For purity at any rate and manliness, if I may say so, we must certainly go to these writers, since today even our style of speaking is infected with all the faults of modern decadence.""

""To say nothing of the language of the uneducated, we are all of us well aware that whole theatres and the entire crowd of spectators will often commit *barbarisms* in the cries which they utter as one man.""

""I am ready to admit that many of the old philosophers inculcated the most excellent principles and practiced what they preached. But in our own day, the name of philosopher has too often been the mask for the worst vices. For their attempt has not been to win the name of philosopher by virtue and the earnest search for wisdom; instead, they have sought to disguise the depravity of their characters by the assumption of a stern and austere mien accompanied by the wearing of a garb differing from that of their fellow men.""",0,quintillian fume about the culture and practice of his day quintillian live in the first century ad and flourish under the flavian dynasty his iconic work instituto oratoria on the institution of oratory be one of the great work of ancient rome and he go into a great deal on his advice for what be good oratory and how it should operate in society he do give his strong opinion about the current culture and practice of his day here be some of those passage below from instituto oratoria on education and teachers i strongly disapprove of the prevail practice of allow boy to stand up or leap from the seat in the expression of their applause young men even when they be listen to others should be temperate in manifest their approval but in the school of today we see boy stoop forward ready to spring to their foot at the close of each period they not merely rise but rush forward with shout of unseemly enthusiasm the actual practice of declamation have degenerate to such an extent owe to the fault of our teacher that it have come to be one of the chief cause of the corruption of modern oratory such be the extravagance and ignorance of our declaimers but any of these fault be tolerable compare with the practice of chant instead of speak which be the bad feature of our modern oratory whether in the court or in the school and of which i can only say that i do not know whether it be more useless or more repugnant to good taste on music i think i ought to be more emphatic than i have be in state that the music which i desire to see taught be not our modern music which have be emasculate by the lascivious melody of our effeminate stage and have to no small extent destroyed such manly vigor a we still possess no i refer to the music of old which be employ to sing the praise of brave men and be sung by the brave themselves on theater and philosophy the vocabulary of the tragedian be full of dignity while in that of the comedian there be a certain elegance and attic grace they be too more careful about dramatic structure than the majority of modern who regard epigram a the sole merit of every kind of literary work for purity at any rate and manliness if i may say so we must certainly go to these writer since today even our style of speak be infect with all the fault of modern decadence to say nothing of the language of the uneducated we be all of u well aware that whole theatre and the entire crowd of spectator will often commit barbarism in the cry which they utter a one man i be ready to admit that many of the old philosopher inculcate the most excellent principle and practice what they preach but in our own day the name of philosopher have too often be the mask for the bad vice for their attempt have not be to win the name of philosopher by virtue and the earnest search for wisdom instead they have sought to disguise the depravity of their character by the assumption of a stern and austere mien accompany by the wear of a garb differ from that of their fellow men

“Having thus secured the imperial power, he realised the wish of the Roman people, or (I may venture to say) of all mankind; for he had long been the object of expectation and desire to the greater part of the provincials and soldiers, who had known him when a child; and to the whole people of Rome, from their affection for the memory of his father, Germanicus, and compassion for the family almost extinct. Upon his moving from Misenum, therefore, although he was in mourning, and reverently attending the corpse of Tiberius, he had to walk amid altars, victims, and lighted torches, with prodigious crowds of people everywhere hailing him in transports of joy, and calling him, beside other auspicious names, their ‘star’, their ‘chick’, their ‘pretty puppet’, and ‘bantling’.” [Suetonius, Caligula 13]

1635246488,What I liked and didn't liked about DOMINA series,"Watched probably every movie/series regarding Rome and had recently discovered this new series that had dropped early this year.

&gt;Domina is a historical drama limited television series created and written by Simon Burke for Sky Atlantic (Italy) and Sky Atlantic (UK). Starring Kasia Smutniak as Livia Drusilla, it examines the power struggles of Ancient Rome from a female perspective.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Wikipedia

Essentially, *Domina* shows the life and rise of Livia Drusilla, the powerful wife of the first Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar.

After watching season 1, here's a list of some things I liked and didn't liked about the show.

**Liked**

1. The [intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LafqAEPbLvg) music is nice.
2. Refreshing to hear Marcus Antonius than Mark Antony.
3. Agrippa's role is given justice here than in BBC's Rome.
4. Fantastic performance by Liam Cunningham who plays Livius, Livia's father.
5. Strong performances by both actresses playing Livia Drusilla.
6. Beautiful choreography. Visually, the show is stunning.
7. Love the costumes. On googling, the costumes were designed by the Academy Award winning Gabriella Pescucci. No wonder they were good.
8. Augustus was known to have nervous breakdowns which is nicely shown in the show.
9. Augustus's dilemma when he was informed that Livia cannot bear him children has been shown in the show.   
Love Livia's quote - ""The one thing he \[Augustus\] wants more than a son is power. Maybe I can give him that.""
10. Teenager Tiberius is shown to be cunning which really might be the actual reality.

**Disliked**

1. Teenager Octavian's hair style like who in Rome had that kind of hair style.
2. Livia's affair with Sextus Pompeius during her refuge in Sicily. Might be purely fictional as I do not know any sources that says this.
3. Marcellus, Octavia's son, is shown to be purely homosexual who cannot even bed his wife. Again, pure fiction.
4. Teenager Tiberius's incestual feeling towards his mother. Yikes. Maybe to provide structure for his Capri's shenanigans in future seasons. Tiberius really cannot catch a break from Seutonius.

The show sacrifices historical accuracy to spice things up but I can ignore that. This show is miles better than other series like Netflix's *The Roman Empire*.",0,what i like and do like about domina series watched probably every regard rome and have recently discover this new series that have drop early this year gt domina be a historical drama limited television series create and write by simon burke for sky atlantic italy and sky atlantic uk starring kasia smutniak a livia drusilla it examines the power struggle of ancient rome from a female perspective gt gt wikipedia essentially domina show the life and rise of livia drusilla the powerful wife of the first roman emperor augustus caesar after watch season here a list of some thing i like and do like about the show liked the intro music be nice refreshing to hear marcus antonius than mark antony agrippa role be give justice here than in bbc rome fantastic performance by liam cunningham who play livius livia father strong performance by both actress play livia drusilla beautiful choreography visually the show be stun love the costume on google the costume be design by the academy award win gabriella pescucci no wonder they be good augustus be know to have nervous breakdown which be nicely show in the show augustus dilemma when he be inform that livia can not bear him child have be show in the show love livia quote the one thing he want more than a son be power maybe i can give him that teenager tiberius be show to be cunning which really might be the actual reality disliked teenager octavian hair style like who in rome have that kind of hair style livia affair with sextus pompeius during her refuge in sicily might be purely fictional a i do not know any source that say this marcellus octavia son be show to be purely homosexual who can not even bed his wife again pure fiction teenager tiberius incestual feel towards his mother yikes maybe to provide structure for his capri shenanigan in future season tiberius really can not catch a break from seutonius the show sacrifice historical accuracy to spice thing up but i can ignore that this show be mile well than other series like netflix the roman empire

1635209074,How did that austere and glossy Byzantine aesthetic come about?,"Let's sit down for a minute and see how this came about. 

I mean that the best art in the Roman empire was from the Julio-Claudian up to early Severan period. I would even magnify it to the Augustan period up until Domitian because the depictions were not only more realistic but also there is more diversity of art. We see animals, hunting scenes, food, sex scenes, gods, etc.. but we also see well done things in later period but with more influence from the provinces. 

This glossy austere Byzantine aesthetic starts poking its head when? The Tetrarchy? I mean we still see some elegant mosaics but we also start seeing less beautiful sculptures; that kind of starts to go.  

But then later we get these goofy Picasso-looking artworks in the frescoes and coins. Which even makes the artworks from Magna Graecia in the pre-Punic period look like masterpieces. The frescoes start having more circles, more glossy backgrounds, less mobility, fewer plants and animals, less delicacy. Everything starts looking austere and watchful. Everybody looks daggers at you.

**Description of Constantine I**  
Constantine (r. as Western Caesar 306-309, as co-Augustus 309-324, as sole emperor 324-337 CE): Constantine was defined above all by his ruthlessness. He killed his two brothers-in-law in order to become sole emperor, effectively destroying the tetrarchy system established by Diocletian. He later had his oldest son and heir, Crispus, executed for an unproven affair. Constantine was the first Christian emperor and although he didn't dare make Christianity the official religion of the empire yet, he did all he could to subsidise Christianity with the taxes from pagans and granted exceptional powers to Christian bishops. He is basically responsible for the collapse of traditional Roman cult and values. He also disbanded the Praetorian Guard, moved to capital to Byzantium, which in a megalomaniac fashion he renamed after himself Constantinople. Constantine created a Police State, a large and corrupt administration (a ""Byzantine"" administration as it later became known) and reinforced the hereditary class system introduced by Diocletian. He formalised the distinction between the frontier army and the better paid mobile army, a decision which the Greek historian Zosimus claims was responsible for the ultimate collapse of the Western Roman Empire.",0,constantine i place among the worst emperors was reading through this list and come across this bs here be a list of the main emperor rat in category from best to bad in term of policy diplomatic administrative and military skill ability to keep peace achievement and impact description of constantine i constantine a western caesar a a sole emperor ce constantine be define above all by his ruthlessness he kill his two in order to become sole emperor effectively destroy the tetrarchy system establish by diocletian he later have his old son and heir crispus execute for an unproven affair constantine be the first christian emperor and although he do dare make christianity the official religion of the empire yet he do all he could to subsidise christianity with the tax from pagan and grant exceptional power to christian bishop he be basically responsible for the collapse of traditional roman cult and value he also disband the praetorian guard move to capital to byzantium which in a megalomaniac fashion he rename after himself constantinople constantine create a police state a large and corrupt administration a byzantine administration a it later become know and reinforce the hereditary class system introduce by diocletian he formalise the distinction between the frontier army and the well paid mobile army a decision which the greek historian zosimus claim be responsible for the ultimate collapse of the western roman empire

I'm working on a Fantasy book that uses the Roman Empire as inspiration for a particular region of my world.

So, I'm trying to find the political breakdown of leaders, regions they controlled, and the approximate size of the area. A Dux controlled how much territory? What level were they in the hierarchy? What was the name of an area controlled by a Dux? A Duchy?

Google is vague on this or doesn't understand what I'm asking; either way, Reddit has helped me before in my research for other aspects, and I'm hoping it can again. Also, I'm trying to keep all titles and nouns in the original Latin; therefore, if you could also draw parallels to something like the English political breakdown through nobility, that would be great!

1634991804,Khosrow advanced towards Hierapolis and Beroia.,"Background of the invasions of Khosrow I into the lands of Justinian in the year 540.

[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ancientrome/comments/qdcj44/may_540_khosrow_i_invades_the_east/)

&amp;#x200B;

With that I go back to my previous narrative,

The emperor Justinian, learning of the Persian invasion, immediately sent his nephew Germanos with three hundred followers in great disorder, promising him that a large army would soon follow. Upon reaching Antioch, Germanos went around the whole circuit of the wall; the greater part of it he found secure, for the part along the plain is washed by the Orontes river, blocking it off to attackers, while the part on higher ground rises upon steep hills and is quite inaccessible to the enemy. But when he reached the highest point, which the men of that place call Orokasias, he noticed that the wall at that point was very easy to assail. For there happens to be in that place a rock that spreads out to a considerable width and rises to a height only a little less than the fortifications.

He therefore commanded that they should either cut off the rock by making a deep ditch along the walls, in case anyone tried to mount from there upon them, or they should build upon it a great tower and connect its structure with the city wall.

&amp;#x200B;

The engineers protested that there would not be enough time to complete such a project. They argued that the rapidly marching spah(army) would arrive quickly at Antioch while these engineering works were still under construction. The Sassanians would then quickly realize the weakness imperilling Antioch and seek to take advantage of it. Germanos grudgingly accepted the logic of these arguments, apparently hopeful that a large force would soon be sent by Justinian from Constantinople

The Antiochenes deciding it was best to send money to Khosrow to negotiate with him to leave, sent Megas a Bishop of Beroia who was residing at Antioch at the time. Quoting Prokopios as follows,

&gt;Coming into the presence of Chosroes, he entreated him to take pity upon men who had committed no offense against him and who were unable to resist the Persian army. For it was least of all proper for a man who was king to trample upon and do violence to those who were retreating before him and were unwilling to resist him. Not one thing that he was then doing was kingly or noble because, without giving the emperor of the Romans any time in which to deliberate whether to make the peace secure in the way that seemed best to both sides, or to prepare for war in accordance with a mutual agreement, as was reasonable, he had recklessly advanced in arms against the Romans, even before their emperor knew what was going on.  
&gt;  
&gt;When Chosroes heard this, he was unable by reason of his ignorance to moderate his stance, but was confirmed in his intention even more than before. He therefore threatened to destroy all the Syrians and Kilikians and, instructing Megas to follow him, led his army to Hierapolis.

&amp;#x200B;

Khosrow set up camp outside the city and sent Paulos as an interpreter. This Paulos had been raised in Roman territory and had attended an elementary school in the city. Said to be Roman in origin. The city of Hierapolis agreed and gave Khosrow 2,000 Pounds of Silver. Megas who arrived from Antioch tried to force Khosrow into an agreement that he would ask for 10 Kentenaria of gold (1,000 pounds of Gold, equal to 1,0000,00 sesterces.) and in exchange Khosrow would leave Roman lands. Khosrow agreed. He took the ransom and advanced towards Beroia.

&amp;#x200B;

Khosrow upon reaching Beroia demanded twice the amount received from Hierapolis as he saw much structural weaknesses on the city walls. Prokopios does not specify what structural weakness is present. The Beroians agreed to give 2,000 Pounds of silver but were unable to give the rest. Khosrow pressed them further to give more. During the night, the Beroians retreated into the acropolis of the city. The next day, Khosrow sent men to receive the money, but upon realising the city gates were barred, he ordered his men to scale the walls with ladders and assault the city. They did so with little resistance. Khosrow then besieged the acropolis within the city, burning the rest of the city as punishment. The Beroians made the mistake of bringing their animals into the acropolis as there was only 1 spring which was drank dry by the animals.

Megas reached Antioch and failed to carry out his side of the agreement as Justinian had sent Ioannes, the son of Rouphinos, and Ioulianos, his private secretary, as envoys to Chosroes. The Romans call this office a secretis, for secrets they conventionally call secreta. These men had reached Antioch and were staying there. Ioulianos, one of the envoys, explicitly forbade everyone from giving money to the enemy or purchasing the cities of the emperor. He also denounced to Germanos the chief priest Ephraimios as being eager to deliver the city over to Khosrow. For this reason Megas returned unsuccessful. But Ephraimios, the bishop of Antioch, fearing the attack of the Persians, ran to cilicia.195

Megas failing in his task, arrive in all haste to Beroia and was shocked at what had befallen the city and reproached Khosrow for the act, quoted by Prokopios,

&gt;Megas then came in haste to Beroia and, in anguish at what had taken place, he accused Chosroes of having treated the Beroians in an unholy way, for while he had sent him to Antioch to arrange a treaty, he had plundered the property of the citizens, although they had committed no wrong at all, and had forced them to shut themselves up in that fortress; he had then set fire to the city and unjustly razed it to the ground.

Khosrow replied as follows,

&gt;My friend, you yourself are responsible for these things, by forcing us to delay here; for you have arrived not at the appointed time, but far too late. As for the strange conduct of your fellow citizens, my good man, why should we discuss it at length? After agreeing to give us a fixed amount of silver in exchange for their own safety, they even now do not think it necessary to fulfill the agreement but, placing such complete confidence in the strength of their position, they are disregarding us absolutely, so we are now compelled to undertake the siege of a fortress, as you see. For my part, I hope that with the help of the gods I will have vengeance upon them shortly, and execute upon the guilty the punishment for the Persians whom I have lost wrongfully before this wall.

Megas replied as follows,

&gt;If one were to consider that you are making these charges as a king against pitiable and lowly men, he would be compelled to agree with you without a word of protest; for the nature of kings is such that prevailing in arguments is a function of their power in general.  
&gt;  
&gt;But if one is permitted to shake off all else and focus on the truth of the matter, you would have nothing, O king, with which to reproach us justly. Please hear me out gently. As for me, since the time I was sent to declare to the Antiochenes the message that you wanted announced to them, seven days have passed—truly, what could be done faster than that?— and now, coming into your presence, I find these things done by you against my fatherland.  
&gt;  
&gt;But these men, having already lost all that is most valuable, have only one struggle to engage in thereafter, that for their lives; they are now, I think, in a position beyond having to pay the rest of the money to you. For by no device can a man pay a thing that he does not have. The names of things have been long distinguished by men well and suitably, and among these distinctions is that inability is separate from ingratitude. For when the latter, through intemperate manners, leads to resistance, it tends to be detested, as is only natural, but when the former, because of the impossibility of performing a service, is driven to the same point, it deserves to be pitied.  
&gt;  
&gt;Permit this, O king, that, while we receive as our lot all the direst misfortunes, we may take with us this consolation at least, that we are spared a reputation for having been ourselves responsible for the things that have befallen us. As for money, consider that what you have taken is sufficient for you; think that their proper measure is not your rank, but the power of the Beroians. Do not force us beyond that, so that you not seem unable to accomplish your purpose, for excess is always punished by obstacles that cannot be overcome, and the best course is not to attempt the impossible. Let this, now, be my defense on behalf of these men. If I were able to converse with those poor sufferers, I might have something else also to tell you that has now escaped me.

Khosrow allowed Megas to enter the Acropolis. Upon realising the situation, Megas came before Khosrow in tears and lying prone on the ground, insisted that the Beroians had no money left and begged him to grant them their lives. Moved by this Khosrow spared the city. Few soldiers remained in the city. Most deserted to the Persians. Speculation is that Justinian had not paid the Limitanei in the east. Their low morale proved easy for most to defect to Khosrow. Khosrow upon hearing that the Antiochenes had refused to pay him, advanced upon Antioch, bringing Megas with him.

Such is the events of the campaigns of Khosrow I in may 540, the next post will be covering the siege of Antioch. Till next time.

Additional info, \[195\] Ephraimios of Amida was a Syriac-speaker who had learned Greek. Before becoming bishop of Antioch (527–545), he had served as comes Orientis and had helped Antioch rebuild after the earthquake of 526. As bishop he was a fierce Chalcedonian and wrote treatises (now lost) against Severos of Antioch.

So my question goes, for the Alani people that migrated west during  the Migration Period, and that settled in Central Hispania, plus the other Alani foederati settled in Gaul, do we know what religion did they practice? I know most germans were Arians, and that the Medieval Alans as well as their modern desceandants the Ossetians are Orthodox Christians. However I read somewhere that the Alans previous to their christianitzation practiced a religion somewhat similar to Zoroastrianism but with more polytheistic elements.

1634746682,Flavius Eutropius: His rise and fall (395-399),"**His Rise**

We all know the chaotic last days of emperor Valens and the battle of Adrianopolis. This was the Rome where young Eutropius grew up. 

He was castrated as a child, becoming a eunuch slave to many prominent eastern officers. 

Fortune was on his side for when general Theodosius was considered illegitimate by the western court, Eutropius supported him, even going to Thebes to consult a Christian prophet who says that Theodosius will indeed win against Eugenius. 

Once Theodosius consolidated his hold on the empire; Eutropius became a powerful chamberlain in the palace of Constantinople. Already a distinguished and worldly man, he was respected by Theodosius and worked with Rufinus, the prefect of the east. 

Eutropius arranged a marriage between Arcadius and the daughter of a Frankish general, Bauto. She is Aelia Eudoxia, the famous empress who would have coins minted in her honor as well as statues.

He was quite crafty in doing this because, in reality, Rufinus wanted Arcadius to marry his daughter and thereby have more control over the weak emperor. This little matchmaking ability of Eutropius would elevate him immensely. Constantinople was his.

He would then tell Arcadius to relax, put his feet up, and travel to Ankara, Galatia, and other places, leaving him free to rule the eastern court more effectively. While Eudoxia had problems of her own, particularly with John Chrysostom, archbishop of Constantinople. 

Moreover, in Africa a revolt of the magister militum per Africam, Gildo, seriously put the empire in trouble and the Senate declared him an enemy of the state, frustrating Stilicho, who already had much on his plate. 

Eutropius felt he couldn't handle everything at once, especially the rampaging army of Goths in the empire headed by Alaric who he made a truce so that he can focus on the Huns. Fortunately for him, the campaign against Uldin and his Hunnic army was a success and he likewise didn't have much trouble from the Persian king, Bahram IV, who likewise was threatened by the Huns. 

**His Consulship and fall**

The success of this campaign made him more popular in the east and so, through the approval of emperor Arcadius and the rest of the imperial court, he became Roman Consul in 399.

One might ask why didn't one of the tough military commanders become consul instead? After all, even Dagalaifus, Bauto, Meroubaudes, and Stilicho became consuls at one point. But this was because Eutropius held all the cards at the time and moreover, none of the other generals and officers had the ear of the royal family as much. The man was a cunning diplomatist. 

But Eutropius's appointment to the consulship didn't just anger the Roman senators and Ravannese court but also many officers in the east, including Aurelianus, former mayor of Constantinople, and a gothic general named Gainas, the latter being Magister militum of the east, through the promotion of Stilicho.

Moreover, Tribigild, leader of the Ostrogoths, hated Eutropius and so made an open revolt. He was assisted by Gainas and together the two forced Arcadius to sign a treaty allowing the Ostrogothic refugees to settle in the empire in return for fighting as foedratii. Another term was the resignation of Eutropius as consul.

Having few to turn to, he sought help from the archbishop of Constantinople, John Chrysostom, who had great influence over the people. But Aelia Eudoxia, the young girl he once arranged to marry Arcadius forced him to capitulate and had weak Arcadius agree to the terms.  

He indeed resign and was exiled to Cyprus.

In AD 174, a sizable contingent of the Roman army was saved from destruction by the timely arrival of a violent rainstorm. This fascinating celestial event is recorded in numerous ancient sources as well as carved in stone upon the Column of Marcus Aurelius. Which god was responsible for this supposed miracle has been a matter of debate since antiquity with sources like Tertullian, Cassius Dio and Apollinaris of Hierapolis weighing in. 

Excerpts from some of the ancient sources on this event, including an intriguing (but probably apocryphal) letter from Marcus Aurelius himself may be found here: [When rain saved the Thundering Legion \~ Legio XII \~ during the Macromannic Wars of Marcus Aurelius](https://gloriaromanorum.blogspot.com/2017/06/when-rain-saved-thundering-legion-legio.html)",0,when a freak storm save the thundering legion during the macromanic wars amp the miracle of the rain a depict on the column of marcus aurelius in rome in ad a sizable contingent of the roman army be save from destruction by the timely arrival of a violent rainstorm this fascinate celestial event be record in numerous ancient source a well a carve in stone upon the column of marcus aurelius which god be responsible for this suppose miracle have be a matter of debate since antiquity with source like tertullian cassius dio and apollinaris of hierapolis weigh in excerpts from some of the ancient source on this event include an intrigue but probably apocryphal letter from marcus aurelius himself may be found here when rain save the thundering legion legio xii during the macromannic wars of marcus aurelius

Then later we start hear about the Batavians, the Chatti, Bructeri, and then much later, for some reason, we hear about the Franks, Vandals, Goths and Quadi. 

The eastern enemy is always more clear and direct. We start of with Antiochus the Great, move over to Tigranes and the Armenians, who are still with us today, and then we start seeing more Parthian action. Eventually, the Persian people rise up and establish the Sassanid dynasty and that's that. They later get crushed by the Arabs, who Theophanes says were once ""tributaries of the Persians"" in his *Chronographia* written in the 800s.

But even Livy mentions the Arabs and their archers in the Battle of Magnesia so there is a very broad discussion about them. 

But eventually, we stop hearing about the great Numidian cavalry, about the Cimbri, the Cherusci, the Marcomanni, the Chatti, the Quadi, even later groups like the Goths and Vandals.

1634583072,Wax tablet writting kit,"Wax tablets were among the instruments romans and other ancients used in order to leave written testimony. These were wooden tablets that had their surfaceses carved and filled with melted beeswax. A stylus would be used to write on the thin wax layer. A wide-end on the stylus, or an apart spatula, would be used in order to rub the wax and delete the text so that something new could be written.

Leather pieces were identified by archaeologists as wax tablet cases. So far i have gathered information about three very similar finds from Vindonissa, Switzerland); Vindolanda, UK; and a third one from unknown provenance. The three of them share size (they differ only by a few cm in lengh), shape and ""decorative"" pattern.

For the cases construction two layers of leather are glued (for which i use collagen glue) and then sewn together with geometrical patterns through very small stitches using a saddle seam. Then narrow strips of leather are used to cover the seams that keep the body and side panels together. 

The leather i used is very high quality vegetable tanned leather from Argentina. The thread is pure linen. And the dyes are natural: for the red i used Rubia tinctorum (aka madder), and atrementum sutoris for the black.

1634404659,What caused the collapse of Roman Paganism? Some surprising clues from Julian the Apostate.,"&amp;#x200B;

[Fourth Century AD fresco from the Via Latina catacombs in Rome showing Jesus approaching the tomb of Lazarus.](https://preview.redd.it/98wkleoefut71.jpg?width=842&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba4a650cfaac9f060163f03ad5377e84b5c72c99)

Why did Roman paganism collapse in the 4th century AD, and why did so many Roman pagans eventually flock to Christianity? Some fascinating evidence may be found in the surviving works of Julian the Apostate. Considering he was a Christian himself (indeed, he was the nephew of Constantine the Great) who reverted to paganism, Julian is able to offer some unique insights into what the average Roman found so attractive in Christianity, and why paganism seemed so moribund by comparison. In his letter to Arascius, pagan high-priest of Galatia, written in AD 362, Julian offers advice on how to revive pagan practices, while inadvertently revealing some of the weaknesses inherent in paganism and the contrasting strengths of Christianity:

&gt;The Hellenic religion \[that is, paganism\] does not yet prosper as I desire, and it is the fault of those who profess it; for the worship of the gods is on a splendid and magnificent scale, surpassing every prayer and every hope. May Adrasteia \[a pagan goddess\] pardon my words, for indeed no one, a little while ago, would have ventured even to pray for a change of such a sort or so complete within so short a time. Why, then, do we think that this is enough, why do we not observe that it is their benevolence to strangers, their care for the graves of the dead and the pretended holiness of their lives that have done most to increase atheism?”

[A defaced bronze as of Nero.](https://preview.redd.it/8krwf4qfmus71.jpg?width=445&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87613af4d9ae9a30df6f821a9f4fdd5840eb6a20)

""Politicized Romans often had a visceral reaction to the fall of defeated generals, politicians, emperors and members of the imperial family that frequently involved the destruction of statues, the defacing of coins, and the erasure of inscriptions. Furthermore, it sometimes became a matter of imperial policy for newly-elevated emperors to call for the annihilation of all images of their opponents, the melting of imperial coinage bearing the likeness of the disgraced, and even making the utterance of the disgraced person's name a crime worthy of severe punishment. This is known by the more modern term *damnatio memoriae*, and it was a reasonably common feature of Roman political life.

1633969947,Contemporary depictions of Spartacus,"Hello guys,

I’ve read quite a bit about Spartacus and the Third Serville war. Spartacus definitely was a known person in ancient Rome but his reputation also wasn’t positive, so it’s clear that there probably were no monuments build to honor him.

What’s known about his person is that he probably was a Thracian mercenary (there’s some debate about him being the Gladiator class Thraex instead of him being a Thracian) who somehow got enslaved and was owned by Lentulus Batiatus in Capua and fought as a Gladiator in the Murmillo class.

My first question is if there’s any known contemporary or antique depiction of Spartacus as a Gladiator or slave.

After his escape from the Gladiator school Spartacus quickly became the leader of the escaped slaves.

This leads to my second question; are there any contemporary depictions of Spartacus as the revolt leader or of other leaders of the Third Serville war like Crixus or Oenomaus?

If anyone knows contemporary or antique mosaics/reliefs etc that could depict Spartacus I’d greatly appreciate you leaving a comment here :)",0,contemporary depiction of spartacus hello guy i ve read quite a bit about spartacus and the third serville war spartacus definitely be a know person in ancient rome but his reputation also wasn t positive so it s clear that there probably be no monument build to honor him what s know about his person be that he probably be a thracian mercenary there s some debate about him be the gladiator class thraex instead of him be a thracian who somehow get enslave and be own by lentulus batiatus in capua and fought a a gladiator in the murmillo class my first question be if there s any know contemporary or antique depiction of spartacus a a gladiator or slave after his escape from the gladiator school spartacus quickly become the leader of the escape slave this lead to my second question be there any contemporary depiction of spartacus a the revolt leader or of other leader of the third serville war like crixus or oenomaus if anyone know contemporary or antique etc that could depict spartacus i d greatly appreciate you leave a comment here

More than half of the Seleucid empire was swallowed up by Mithridates I. Parthia was transformed from a small kingdom into a major political power. 

We know that at this time there was the bloody campaigns in the Iberian peninsula and also the attempt to pacify Carthage and Greece as much as possible. 

But surely the Romans must have heard of the immense force that happened to swallow up their rival empire. The Seleucids were in a civil war and as a result of this, their empire was fragile. 

Or how about when Demetrius II was captured by the Parthians? That must have been quite interesting. 

The Seleucids finally lost their empire to Pompey, but in all honesty, the Romans could have rounded up the Greek allies and Egypt by the 120s BC or so and take them down.

Picking out the most effective Roman rulers from the first through third centuries has been a topic of discussion and debate since antiquity. If you read *The Caesars*, an ancient satire written by Julian the Apostate, you know that even emperors were keen to have that conversation.

But what of the Christian emperors? The 4th through 7th centuries are often considered periods of decay and decline for the Roman Empire. I view them, however, as times of crisis and regeneration, as the previously pagan Empire was transformed into an amazingly resilient Christian Empire which persisted for another millennium despite attacks on all sides and myriad convulsions from within.

Who were the most effective rulers during this period? Opinions vary, but here are my choices. Portraits of all, taken from antiquity, may be found in the above image. A brief biography of each may be found here:

1633644031,The admiration for the Gordians was Rome yearning for its glory days,"If Gordian actually was able to make it out of Africa and install a dynasty in Rome, we could have perhaps have seen the empire stabilize. He was old and would be followed by his son, Marcus. 

The Roman people didn't like Thrax because he was a brute barbaric soldier who didn't at all resemble the ideal Roman. They also knew that Alexander had no heir left and that it was also high time for a completely different family to rule Rome. 

They liked the Gordians because they resembled the principate leaders. They had titles, he was once governor of Britannia, consul with Elagabalus, as well as an aedile who threw splendid games. He grew up in the age of Marcus Aurelius which, despite, being dead for fifty-five years, was still fondly remembered and admired. 

Why did everybody demand Pupienus and Balbinus, hated as they were, to adopt Gordian III as emperor? Because by this period, there was immense contempt for senators, especially those two. 

But then again, why didn't Timesitheus just kill or imprison Gordian? Wasn't it better to be the Augustus instead of letting some kid do it?

1633623095,What happened to the Italian housing market during the Crisis of the third century?,"We'll notice that Italy didn't have as much damage as Gaul or the eastern provinces. You would think that the housing market would go up since so many damn people probably wanted to get the hell out of the dangerous provinces and settle into Italy. When I say Italy, I mean below the Rubicon. We're not counting Mediolanum, Aquilea, and the cities on the Po.

I figured the property values went up in Rome but at the same time what about the suburra and all of the insulae? I bet that place got really dirty in the crisis. Especially after the plague. 

We hear about Cornelius Saecularis yelling at the church deacon Laurentius to hand over the church's money to him and we also have the story of Decius persecuting all the Christians in Rome so I would imagine that by that time, there was a lot of low-income people who the church helped. 

But let's keep in mind that Aurelian also did some great work in Rome, restoring the baths of Caracalla, fixing roads, and, of course, adding the Aurelian walls. So its not like Rome was all dirty and gross. 

But at the same time, how many people were actually producers? Think of all the people on the dole, all the slaves, and all the women and children. This makes me think that around the third century, only about 15% to 20% of the people within the Aurelian walls were actually property owners. 

Why did they have to build a bathhouse? Couldn't the urban prefect push for more affordable housing? Or at least put regulations on patricians building all these nice gardens for themselves that take up so much space?",0,what happen to the italian housing market during the crisis of the third century we notice that italy do have a much damage a gaul or the eastern province you would think that the housing market would go up since so many damn people probably want to get the hell out of the dangerous province and settle into italy when i say italy i mean below the rubicon we not counting mediolanum aquilea and the city on the po i figure the property value go up in rome but at the same time what about the suburra and all of the insulae i bet that place get really dirty in the crisis especially after the plague we hear about cornelius saecularis yell at the church deacon laurentius to hand over the church money to him and we also have the story of decius persecute all the christians in rome so i would imagine that by that time there be a lot of people who the church help but let keep in mind that aurelian also do some great work in rome restore the bath of caracalla fix road and of course add the aurelian wall so it not like rome be all dirty and gross but at the same time how many people be actually producer think of all the people on the dole all the slave and all the woman and child this make me think that around the third century only about to of the people within the aurelian wall be actually property owner why do they have to build a bathhouse could the urban prefect push for more affordable housing or at least put regulation on patrician building all these nice garden for themselves that take up so much space
1633617834,Emperor Justinian fails to dissuade Khosrow I from his invasion,"For those out of the loop, you can check out my post here, 
[539 AD, the year before Khosrow I initiates his invasion. He is seen receiving the envoys of Gothic and Roman armenians](https://www.reddit.com/r/ancientrome/comments/pzqio4/here_is_an_interesting_dialogue_of_gothic_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

With that, i return to my previous narrative, In late 539 or early 540, Emperor Justinian perceiving Khosrow’s desire for war, sent him a letter through a man named Anastasios. Not to be confused with Emperor Anastasios. 

Justinian to Khosrow I, 

“It is the mark of men  
of discretion and of those  
who practice their religion,  
when causes of war arise, especially  against men who are their true friends,  to exert all their power to prevent them;  but it belongs to foolish men and those  who, in their lives, make light of religion  to devise occasions for war and turmoil  that have no real existence. 

To destroy peace and initiate war is not  a difficult matter, as the nature of things  is to make the most wicked activities  easy for the most dishonorable men. But  when they have brought about war  according to their intention, to return  again to peace is for men, I think, not  easy. 

You charge me with writing letters that  were in fact not written with any dark  purpose and you are eager to interpret  them arbitrarily, not in the sense in  which we intended them when we wrote  them but in a way that will be of  advantage to you in your eagerness to  carry out your plans behind a smoke  screen.  

But for us it is possible to point out that  your al-Mundhir recently overran our  land and performed outrageous deeds  in a time of peace, capturing towns,  seizing property, massacring and  enslaving a great multitude of men,  concerning which it is not your part to  accuse us but to defend yourself. 

For the crimes of those who have done  wrong are made manifest to their  neighbors by their acts, not their thoughts.  Even with things as they are,  we have still decided to hold to peace,  but we hear that in your eagerness to  make war upon the Romans you are  fabricating accusations that do not  bear  on us at all.  

Naturally enough, for those who are eager to preserve the present order of  things reject even those accusations  against their friends that are most compelling, yet those who dislike the  institution of friendship are drawn even  to pretexts that do not exist. But this  would not be becoming even to ordinary  men, much less to kings. 

Setting these things aside, think on the  number of those who will be killed  
on both sides in a war and who will  justly bear the blame for what happens;  consider also the oaths you took when  you accepted the money and consider  that, if you wrongly dishonor them by  tricks and sophistries, you would still not  be able to avert them,  for God is too mighty to be deceived by any man.”

Khosrow, after reading the letter was silent for a while before compelling Anastasios, the messenger to stay alongside him. 

Khosrow invaded the Eastern Roman Empire along the Euphrates river in around May 540AD. 

I’ll break these posts into parts and go through the process of the whole invasion.

Maybe an unpopular opinion as Aphrodite is more known, but Isis cult was bigger than Venus apparently, that might not define it straightforward though. Venus was popular among Romans due to Caesar and his family and the Aenied. 

All the temples of her and were due to her being related to Caesars family. But honestly I don't see her asa very important deity compared to Juno, Minerva, Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus were more important from what I've read, been studying this for about a week nonstop out of interest and I clearly see which god was truly important and which was important but not as much.

1633370512,Roman Empire was half Mythology half Christian,"Christianity was allowed by the Romans or at least tolerated from 30 AD to 64 AD. From then, even before all the way to 250, Roman Paganism was dominant at every way of course, until 250 when it was still the dominant religion but Christianity started to flourish in the Roman Empire until 297 for nearly 40 years, until Empreror Diocletian launched a last attack on Christianity to persecute it, this became the case until 313, when Constantine allowed any Roman to follow whatever religion they wanted. So Christianity again started to flourish even more seriously until it became the official state religion in 385. And this lasted till the fall of the western Roman empire. 



So when I think of the Roman Empire, I think of initially Mythology dominating the state, until Christianity started to rise around 250 seriously. So I also think the end of the Roman empire represented Christianity.

1633265362,Romulus wasn't related to Greek Gods like Aphrodite,"I've done a study on Romulus and Remus. In my opinion they are not related at all to some of the GREEK Gods like Aphrodite/Venus. Romans worshipped their own gods from their own timeline, like Jupiter, which did have counterparts to Greek gods but were very different. But the story of Venus is basically the story of Aphrodite: even though she was another god, she was clearly a foreign god, and her stories and myths take place from Greece or around it, and Greek as it a foreign god and not Roman when it comes to the STORY.

1633181499,89 AD: The Revolt of Saturninus - Civil War averted,"Legio XIV Gemina and Legio XXI Rapax proclaimed Lucius Antonius Saturninus as their new Augustus. He was the governor of Germania Superior and had a massive force behind him. 

This was another example of a dissatisfied officer who hated the emperor, similar to Vindex in Nero's days, which many people at the time remembered. Domitian was paying subsidies to the Dacians and preventing any generals from advancing in their careers. Saturninus sought help from the Chatti but they were disorganized and the Rhine was not frozen which made things more difficult for them. 

But more importantly, when this rebellious officer erupted and proclaimed himself emperor, nobody really backed him. The governor of Germania Inferior, Lappius, went up with his troops and this was also followed by troops in Rhaetia and even from Hispania, commanded by Trajan. 

The rebellious army of Saturninus was put down and the leaders were beheaded. Finally, Domitian ordered his officers to send their decapitated heads to Rome and when they arrived, he had them placed on the rostra in the forum so everybody can see.

1633159333,Here is an interesting dialogue of Gothic and Armenia ambassadors coming to the court of Khosrow I trying to persuade him to invade the Eastern Roman Empire,"In around 539, the Ostrogoths now being pushed out of most of their holdings in Italy due to the recent conquests of the general Belisarius, desperation sought them to send envoys to sneak past the Eastern Roman Empire’s borders to the Sassanian empire in which by now Khosrow I had managed to stabilize his empire and is looking for a pretext to end the “eternal peace treaty” first signed between him and Emperor Justinian during Khosrow I early unstable years. 

Khosrow I needed to stabilize his reign, so signed the peace treaty. The gothic envoys appearing in his court gave Khosrow much assurances to break off the treaty with the Romans. Here’s the dialogue as follows,

“In general, O king, all other envoys set  out on embassies to gain some  advantage for themselves, but we have  been sent by Vittigis, the king of the  Goths and Italians, in order to speak on  behalf of your rule; and hear us as if he  were now present before you speaking these words. 

If anyone were to say, O king, putting it all in a word, that you have given up  your kingdom and all your men to  Justinian, he would be speaking  correctly. 

For he is by nature a troublemaker, he covets things that in no way belong to  him, and is unable to abide by the  settled order of things, so he has  conceived the desire of seizing the  entire earth and is eager to acquire for  himself each and every state. Accordingly, as he was not able to  attack the Persians on his own nor, with  the Persians opposing him, to move against the others, he decided to  deceive you with the smoke screen of  peace and, by forcing the others into  subjection, to acquire mighty forces to  use against your state. 

He has already destroyed the kingdom  of the Vandals and subjugated the  Moors while the Goths stood aside for  him because of their friendship; now he  has come against us with vast sums of  money and many men.  

It is evident that, if he is able also to  crush the Goths utterly, he will march  against the Persians with us and those  he has already enslaved, neither considering the name of friendship nor  respecting any of his sworn promises.  So while some hope of safety is still left  to you, do not do us any further wrong  nor suffer it yourself but see in our  misfortunes what will a little later  happen to the Persians. Consider that  the Romans could never be well-disposed to your kingdom; when they become more powerful they will not  hesitate at all to display their enmity  toward the Persians.  

Use this option while it presents itself  now, so that you not regret it after it has  passed.  For when the moment  of  opportunity passes, it is not in its nature  to return again. It is better by  anticipating to be in security, than to miss your chance and suffer the most miserable fate at the hands of the enemy.”

Events were also sparking up in the Caucasus region of Roman Armenia, a smaller portion partitioned between the Persians. The Persians controlled a bigger portion of Armenia. 

There was a man by the name of Akakios who was Proconsul Armenia Magnae from 536-538/39. He was considered a man of treacherous character in which described by Procopius framed his former predecessor Amazasp of wanting to give territories to Theodosioupolis and other fortress to the persians. He was later executed. He was appointed in the position from 531-536. 

The man Akakios proceeded to in Procopius’s words,” Plundered their properties without excuse and imposed on them an unheard of tax of four Kentanaria. But the Armenians unable to bear him any longer, conspired together, slew Akakios, and fled for refugee to Pharangion.” 
 
Magister Militum Praesentalis Sittas (530-538/39) who distinguished himself in the early wars between the Romans and Sassanians during the rule of Emperor Anastasios and Kavad I was sent to quell the uprising. At first he sent promises to the Armenians and was trying to avoid conflict. However Justinian reproached the man for his hesitance and Sittas was forced to engage the Armenians in battle. 

The battle was not a big one. A skirmish between them in a small cavalry battle with a river between both cavalry armies. General Sittas was killed. Describes as follows by Procopius, “ The enemy  advanced upon him with great  eagerness and a soldier overtook him in  the ravine and struck him a glancing blow with his sword on the top of his  head; he took off the whole scalp but  the steel did not injure the bone at all.  

Sittas continued to press on still more  than before, but Artabanes, the son of  Ioannes of the Arsakids, rushed him  from behind, thrust his spear at him, and  killed him. Thus Sittas was removed  from the world for no good reason and  in a manner unworthy of his valor and  continual achievements against the  enemy, a man who was handsome in  appearance, a capable warrior, and a  general second to none of his  contemporaries.”

The Roman Armenians therefore sent their own ambassadors to Khosrow I. Here is the dialogue, 

“Many of us, Master, are Arsakids,  descendants of that Arsakes who was  not unrelated to the Parthian kings  when  the Persian realm was under the power of the Parthians, and who proved  himself an illustrious king, inferior to  none of his contemporaries.[184] Now  we have come before you as all of us  have become slaves and fugitives, not,  however, by choice but because we  have been compelled.  

It might seem that this was because of  Roman power but in truth, O king, it is  because of your decision. If, that is, he  who gives the means to those who wish  to do injustice justly bears the blame for  their misdeeds. 

Now we will go over past events so that you can follow their whole course. Arsakes, the last king of our ancestors,  abdicated his throne willingly for Theodosios, the emperor of the  Romans, on condition that all who  belonged to his family for the rest of  time should govern their own lives and,  in particular, should be subject to no  taxation.[185] 

And we have preserved the agreement until you, the Persians, made this  notorious treaty that, we think, it would  not be wrong to call a pact of universal  destruction. From that time you have disregarded both friend and foe, and  that man who is in name your friend, O king, but in fact your enemy has turned  everything in the world upside down and  brought complete confusion. 

You yourself will realize this quickly, in fact as soon as he is able to subdue  completely the people of the West. For  what thing that was previously  forbidden has he not done? Or what  was well established that he has not  shaken up? 

Did he not ordain for us the payment of  a tax that did not exist before, and has  he not enslaved our neighbors, the  Tzanoi, who were autonomous, and has  he not set over the king of the wretched  Lazoi a Roman governor, an act neither  in keeping with the natural order of  things nor very easy to explain in  words? 

Has he not sent generals to the men of Bosporos, the subjects of the Huns,  taking over the city that in no way  belongs to him, and has he not made a  defensive alliance with the Ethiopian  realms, which the Romans had never  even heard of before? He has taken  possession of the Himyarites and the  Red Sea and is adding the Palm Groves  to the Roman realm. 

We omit to speak about the sufferings of the Libyans and the Italians. The whole  earth is not large enough for the man; it  is too small a thing for him to conquer  all  people together. But he is even looking  in the heavens and searching in the  nooks and crannies beyond the Ocean,  wishing to gain for himself some other  world.[186]

Why, then, O king, do you still delay?  Why do you respect that most evil  peace, just so that he may make you the  last bite of all? If you want to know what  kind of a man Justinian shows himself  to those who yield to him, an illustration  is to be found near at hand: ourselves  and the wretched Lazoi. If you wish to  see how he tends to treat those who are  unknown to him and who have not done  him the least wrong, consider the  Vandals, Goths, and Moors. 

But the chief thing has not yet been  said. Has he not made efforts in time of  peace to win over by deception your  slave, al-Mundhir,  O most mighty king,  and cause him to break away from your  kingdom? Has he not tried recently to  win over Huns who are utterly unknown  to him, in order to make trouble for you?  

Yet a stranger act than this has not been  done in the whole of time. For since he  perceived, as I think, that the overthrow  of the western world would speedily be  accomplished, he has already begun to  make plans against you in the East, as  the Persian power alone has been left  for him to grapple with. 

The peace, therefore, as far as concerns  him, has already been broken for you,  and he himself has put an end to the  Endless Peace. For those break a peace,  not who are the first to arms, but who  are caught plotting against their  neighbors in a time of peace. The crime  has been committed by him who  attempts it, even though success  eludes him. 

As for the course the war will follow, this  is surely clear to everyone.  For it is not  those who furnish causes for war, but  those who defend themselves against  those who furnish them, who tend to  conquer  their  enemies. In fact, the  contest will not be evenly matched  for  us even in point of strength.  

As it happens, the majority of Roman  soldiers are at the ends of the earth, and  as for the two generals who were the  best they  had, we come here having  slain the one, Sittas, and Belisarios will  never again be seen by Justinian. For  disregarding his master, he has  remained in the West, holding the power  of Italy himself. So that when you go  against the enemy, no one at all will  confront you, and you will have us  guiding the army with goodwill, as is  natural, and with a thorough knowledge  of the country.”

Do we have any surviving commentary on small unit actions, however?  Things like foraging parties defending themselves, raids, rear-guard, etc?  Do we know what unit types deployed, how much equipment was expected to be fielded, or what sort of tactical approach was advised?

This is driven by wargaming as well as general interest - I'd recently pondered using a system like Lion Rampant to do small-scale skirmish battles in Roman AORs, which got me thinking about the sorts of scenarios involved in games of that small a scale and what kind of troops a thoroughly professional force like Rome is famous for sends off on these kinds of operations.  I know in big battles they have dedicated light skirmish troops, but I don't know if they're the ones stuck doing small unit actions or if Legionaries get pushed out the camp for it as well.",0,small unit action in the roman army i not too up and up on roman history but i have see a few thing on how their army operates everything i read though across all age deal with combat big pitch battle siege thing of that nature these be event where soldier be they marian reform recruit or late imperial type be in full and make use of all their tactic technique and procedure like we expect do we have any survive commentary on small unit action however things like forage party defend themselves raid etc do we know what unit type deployed how much equipment be expect to be field or what sort of tactical approach be advise this be driven by wargaming a well a general interest i recently ponder use a system like lion rampant to do skirmish battle in roman aors which get me think about the sort of scenario involve in game of that small a scale and what kind of troop a thoroughly professional force like rome be famous for sends off on these kind of operation i know in big battle they have dedicate light skirmish troop but i do know if they the one stuck do small unit action or if legionaries get push out the camp for it a well

- this shift did not happen due to foreign interference or invasion. It was a domestic phenomenon.

- this shift did not result in the Empire's downfall

- this shift was permanently successful

- Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten, but 1) that wasn't the same 180 degree change to a different religion, like the Romans; and 2) he was ultimately unsuccessful

I'm currently looking for ways to refresh and expand my knowledge on ancient rome, and I was hoping some fellow history enthousiasts here could give me some pointers.

Apart from crucial events, I would highly appreciate any historically accurate sources on
- geopolitical changes (i.e. the expansion of ancient rome, interactions with other nations, rise and fall of cities) 
- Political structures and changes therein
- What everyday life looked like, and how this changed throughout their era
- Cultural aspects, for example arts and crafts

So most perspectives apart from warfare really.

Anything with visuals (documentaries, series etc) would be ideal, but suggestions for podcasts or books are more than welcome as well.

1632824916,Good books about ancient Gods as psychological forces?,"tl;dr 1. What are the most striking examples that come to your mind, within any (ancient) mythological tradition, in which Gods are clearly performing the role of (unconscious) psychological actors within human beings?

2. What are good books in which the Greco-Roman Gods are defined, systematized and explained in psychological terms, preferably on the basis of source material?

Dear all,

In the first book of the Iliad, a chuckling king (and tyrannical leader of the Greeks) Agamemnon tells his best warrior, Achilles, that he is taking the slave girl Briseis as his own war booty, even though Achilles had claimed Briseis earlier. As Achilles gets rowdy and starts to defy his king’s decision, the king doubles down on his decision, leaving little room for doubt as for who is in charge: ‘Sit down, Achilles, I am the king and I can do whatever I want.’ Achilles is blinded by rage, puts his hand on his sword and is about to charge Agamemnon and cut him down, but then the Goddess Athena flies down from the Olympus and literally ‘pulls Achilles back by his hair’, making him reconsider; he slides his sword back into its shaft. Reason overcomes blind rage.

Now, some people seem to assume that the Greeks literally believed that there were Gods living on a mountaintop (the Olympus), invisible to the humans as it is surrounded by clouds. But the Olympus is ***not*** surrounded by clouds many days of the year (during the summer): They could easily see that there weren’t actual ‘Gods’ living there. And the ancients weren’t idiots...

It is clear through the above example of Athena that the Gods were a way to explain our human condition, and that the ancients ***needed*** the Gods to explain one key element within this condition: The fact that we are limited, that we are at the mercy of forces we do not understand. These forces can be natural, i.e. macrocosmical (lightning, rain, earthquakes etc..), but also psychological: For what the hell do we know about why we are the way we are? Why do we think about the things we think about? Thoughts just seem to pop up into our heads. Why do we love who we love? It seems as if there are deeper, unconscious forces underlying our beings. As Jung, Neumann and others put it: We don’t own our thoughts, our thoughts own us.

Next steps down this rabbit hole include e.g. the realisation that we can ‘negotiate’ with these forces, making sacrifices to them, or the sensation that the ***micro***cosmical force (i.e. the God(dess)) which brings about certain psychological states, is but a manifestation of the same ***macro***cosmical force that e.g. makes the crops grow, the wind blow, the Sun shine etc. (cf. Lucretius’ first verses of On the nature of things). They are perceived of as one and the same. But these are different matters.

Two questions for you:

1. Assuming the Greeks/Romans conceived of the Gods as such forces, I should really like to read some secondary literature on this topic. Are there researchers who have defined each God(dess) in psychological terms and listed examples of their acting on human psyches, preferably within Latin and Greek sources? E. R. Dodds comes to mind (‘The Greeks and the Irrational’), but what other books would you recommend in which ancient Gods are systematized and explained in psychological terms, parallel with source material.
2. What are the most striking examples that come to your mind, within any mythological tradition (from the Americas to Oceania), in which Gods are clearly performing the role of (unconscious) psychological actors within human beings?

They had in their mind this killer instinct for organizing and managing things so that everything would go smooth. A big part of that would be engineering, and while I don’t have a great fascination for engineering itself, I love how they understood that water and roads would be the backbone of their empire, and how they implemented this on a huge scale with methodic relentlessness. I like how their castra were always the same, how they built one each night, how each soldier had his shovel and two poles. I like how they standardized pretty much everything, and what kind of practical ingenuity they put in improving everything they could, from the heavy training wooden weapons to the raised blocks to cross the streets in Pompeii. They choose to borrow from others when they saw something better (like the gladius in Hispania), rather than be stuck with so-so traditions, because they were practical. They excelled in some things (engineering is one of those), but I think that their success was deeply rooted in the way they managed things, rather than what they did in this or that field or situation.

I’m pretty much in awe about that.

1632739677,Appreciation for Roman culture/history in the contemporary United States of America,"Here's my controversial post; some of you will be upset, but give me a chance to present my argument. 

In the contemporary United States, there is a lack of appreciation for Ancient Rome. This is unusual because the United States has been greatly influenced by Roman writers and leaders and its past politicians and people greatly appreciated the works of antiquity.

In England during the time of Elizabeth I and James; people were fascinated by ancient Rome. Shakespeare wrote plays on many of its noble figures as did Ben Jonson, Christopher Marlowe, Fletcher, among others. Even to this day, just a few years ago, the Globe Theater did a production of *Boudica* by Tristan Bernays, a modern playwright. 

In France, the story of the collapse of the Republic is much more well known, the paintings and sculptures by artists heavily reference ancient Rome. Even Albert Camus wrote a play on Caligula

Back in 17th century Holland, books by Cicero and Plutarch were being printed en masse and it was quite common for people to learn Latin despite folks speaking Dutch. 

In Venice, many of the famous operas by Vivaldi and Albinoni which almost everybody had access to were based either on Roman gods or Roman history. The same for Vienna in Mozart and Beethoven's time. Post-Soviet Germany also has a great appreciation for ancient Rome*.* 

But in the United States, the entertainment industry has little regard for ancient Roman history and culture. People tend to prefer modern fictional things such as Game of Thrones, Star Wars, Marvel, DC, Lord of the Rings, etc...  and tend to look at ancient Rome as something too archaic and boring.

Mozart's operas on ancient Rome are some of the most ridiculous things you will ever see. It's not based at all on real history. His operas based on Titus and Sulla resemble mostly domestic love dramas. But nevertheless, there was still this appreciation for ancient Rome and the heroes of that age. It was considered sensible to know about ancient Rome.

In the United States, the founding fathers all knew the works of the Roman writers. You were a nobody in early America if you didn't know the works of the ancient Greeks and Romans. 

Why did this go away?

As I read the book, I found an interesting claim in the book that late Ptolemies had been made Roman citizens somewhere before 59 BCE, thus Cleopatra VII herself was either born a citizen or granted citizenship when she was a little girl, making it actually legal for Mark Antony to marry Cleopatra. This fact would be illustrated by the fact that the Roman citizenship issue of Antony and Cleopatra's children was never raised, although, according to Roman law, a child of a Roman citizen and a foreigner who wasn't specially approved for the citizen to marry by the Senate would be a foreigner. 

If Cleopatra VII was really a naturalized or born Roman citizen, then many common assumptions about her relationship with Caesar and Mark Antony would be overturned......But she never used a Roman name in inscriptions, anyway, so whether Duane Roller was right would be unclear.",0,antony and cleopatra an interest turn reading duane roller biography of cleopatra vii one must feel a sense of admiration about how cleopatra vii be able to use roman power to keep egypt from annexation as i read the book i found an interest claim in the book that late ptolemies have be make roman citizen somewhere before bce thus cleopatra vii herself be either born a citizen or grant citizenship when she be a little girl make it actually legal for mark antony to marry cleopatra this fact would be illustrate by the fact that the roman citizenship issue of antony and cleopatra child be never raise although accord to roman law a child of a roman citizen and a foreigner who be specially approve for the citizen to marry by the senate would be a foreigner if cleopatra vii be really a naturalize or born roman citizen then many common assumption about her relationship with caesar and mark antony would be overturn but she never use a roman name in inscription anyway so whether duane roller be right would be unclear

I found this weird and decided to try to find out if there was any truth to it but I can't find anything. As far as I can tell the Gauls lost that siege because they were not expecting an attack during such a heavy rainfall and were caught off guard not because of superstition.  

The show also makes it seem as if Vercingetorix was in the walls of Avaricum during the siege which again I cant find any evidence for and seeing as there are accounts that the romans committed a small genocide against the inhabitants its unlikely that he would have survived the attack which we know he very much did as he fights Caesar some time later. 

If anyone knows where what source they used as reference when making that claim or any other information that would be amazingly helpful.

1630873605,"Questions About the ""Conflict of the Orders""","Hello, I submitted this question to r/askhistorians a few days ago but got no responses so I decided I would try here instead.

I've recently been reading about the early to mid republic and I've seen the case made that the ""conflict of the orders"" was not nearly so clean as once thought. Supposedly, non-patricians served both as consuls and senators very early in the republic. This has left me with a feeling that I misunderstand the nature of classes in Rome.

What was the distinction between non-patrician and patrician gentes? Was it based solely around the patricians' ability to monopolize Rome's traditional priesthoods or were there other differences? Did this distinction evolve over time and when did the term plebeian begin to be used? Would patricians disdain a non-patrician who acquired high office (such as consul) or were they welcomed so long as they defended the interests of the ruling class? If it is true that non-patricians were initially barred from holding lower positions such as quaestor, why were they not barred from holding the more prestigious position of consul? As non-patricians became more common in government did those non-patricians in power come to be associated more with the ruling class or remain associated with their non-patrician status?

1630863955,455: The Year of Three Emperors,"If you thought the assassination of Alexander Severus and the subsequent war that followed was ridiculous, then we should see how crazy the year of the three emperors was. 

The bitter old senator, Petronius Maximus, fuming at the way things were going in the empire, decided to persuade the guards of emperor Valentinian III to kill him in the Campus Martius and declare himself Augustus right then and there in the city of Rome. There were many people who demanded Maximianus, the domesticus of Aetius to be emperor, but the stubborn Roman Senate, opposing everybody one last time, finally managed to install their candidate on the throne. 

It really goes to show how blind and ridiculous that body of men had become by the 5th century.  Not to mention Maximus knew a thing or two about throne usurpation since he basically did what Julianus and Otho did in their respective centuries. Bribe the imperial bodyguards and officials. 

He had Avitus as his Magister Militum and sent him up to the Goths in order to have their support. Of course, in between this, the Vandal king, Geiseric, infuriated by the cancellation of his son's marriage and the death of Valentinian decided to raise hell and invade Italy. 

Finally, the old man was finished off when a mob of people killed him and the empire remained in the hands of confused court officials and an apathetic Roman Senate. For a whole month there was no emperor. 

Finally, a letter arrived saying that Theodoric, king of the Goths, supports Avitus, the Magister Militum, as the new emperor. Of course, the Roman senate just shrugged their shoulders and went along with it. What else could they do? So then Avitus showed up in Italy with a contingent of Gallic and Gothic forces, planted them in Ravenna, and went to his ceremony in Rome. 

All of this in five months' time!

1630201987,How Rome Fell by Goldsworthy - Thoughts,"So I just finished this book and it stirred up some new thoughts about the Fall of Rome, at least for me.  To start I highly recommend Goldsworthy's books on Rome as both readable but still having depth. I'd give it a B + with its only weakness being that is sometimes gets lost in the details and loses the broader narrative.

Anyways, one thing that struck me is inability of the later Empire to raise large armies or replace armies after defeats.  Indeed Roman generals seemed to avoid large scale battles.  Some hypothesize that this was caused by depopulation in Italy and the wider Empire.  Goldsworthy points out that we simply don't have the records to prove this, which is true.  But I couldn't help thinking of the numerous times in the Republic that Rome lost large armies but manage to come back and win by drawing on their reserves of manpower in Italy or the provinces.  The wars with Hannibal would be a prime example.  Huge losses and yet the Romans kept fighting after raising new armies.  In the later Empire the Romans could scarcely inflict a lasting defeat on any of the tribes attacking them.  At most they kept them at bay.  In the prior times they wouldn't have settled for anything short of a decisive victory.  I just can't help but wonder that the number of men needed simply weren't there to keep pushing for a lasting victory.  Some might say civil war had sapped Rome of men, but the Romans fought civil wars under Sulla and Caesar but still managed to protect their boarders shortly after.  Of course those civil wars ended and were followed by peaceful periods of stability.

Did some kind of agriculture decline lower the roman population?  Did taxation hurt the economy and lead to population decline?

1630083271,How did political purges work in the roman times?,"I was doing some reading on the fall of the Republic. It's funny because we modeled our own government off of Roman institutions but similar names only serve to confuse because of the fundamental differences. The senatorial class being hereditary, the way that political and military leadership were interchangeable and how you could have a senator in charge of a legion and that's just not the way things are done now. 

What kind of throws me is how mass killings seem to have been part of the political process. I see it hadn't been for like 400 years and the demise of the Gracchi Brothers brought it back and normalizing that sort of thing is what led to the fall of the Republic because there was no peaceful means of making political demands. 

I would tend to think that for their own well-being, the rich would have made it a point to minimize that sort of thing. Like even in the American Civil War, the Union didn't go about visiting ruin and destruction on the Confederate leadership after the fact. 

I'm just curious as to the public reaction to this at the time, the thoughts of the other elites who are having their safety directly threatened. I'm finding descriptions of what happened (victor proscribed enemies, 3000 killed) but nothing about the fallout. Like when Sulla did it, was this just like the Reign of Terror where people were too scared to speak out lest they become targets? I know after Stalin died the people who inherited leadership of the USSR were like ""Yeah, let's try to make stalinist purges no longer a thing."" The same dynamic seemed to have played out after the death of Mao and they'd managed power-sharing within the party itself until Poo Bear came along and managed to outmaneuver all of his opponents. Still, he's not gotten to the point of mass killing of political rivals among the party elite. 

Kinda rambled there but the question is basically how did contemporaries react to all the purges back then?",0,how do political purge work in the roman time i be do some reading on the fall of the republic it funny because we model our own government off of roman institution but similar name only serve to confuse because of the fundamental difference the senatorial class be hereditary the way that political and military leadership be interchangeable and how you could have a senator in charge of a legion and that just not the way thing be do now what kind of throw me be how mass killing seem to have be part of the political process i see it have be for like year and the demise of the gracchi brothers brought it back and normalize that sort of thing be what lead to the fall of the republic because there be no peaceful mean of make political demand i would tend to think that for their own the rich would have make it a point to minimize that sort of thing like even in the american civil war the union do go about visit ruin and destruction on the confederate leadership after the fact i just curious a to the public reaction to this at the time the thought of the other elite who be have their safety directly threaten i find description of what happen victor proscribed enemy kill but nothing about the fallout like when sulla do it be this just like the reign of terror where people be too scar to speak out l they become target i know after stalin die the people who inherit leadership of the ussr be like yeah let try to make stalinist purge no longer a thing the same dynamic seem to have played out after the death of mao and they manage within the party itself until poo bear come along and manage to outmaneuver all of his opponent still he not gotten to the point of mass kill of political rival among the party elite kinda ramble there but the question be basically how do contemporary react to all the purge back then

1630072806,Sarcophagus of Honorius still under St. Peter's basilica,"I was reading about Old St' Peter's basilica and found about two ""chapels"" that were attached to the south side of the structure. One, the so called ""Vatican Rotunda"" aka chapel of St. Andrew, was originally a 3rd century structure with unknow purpose, probably a tomb. And the second, called the chapel of St. Petronilla during the middle ages, was originally the Tomb of Honorius.

Both are now demolished, and in the 15th century a few sarcophagi were uncovered from the Tomb of Honorius, but apparently not the one of the chicken emperor himself. Could someone provide some additional info, if this could indeed be true that an intact sarcophagus of a Roman Emperor is still lying in the ground under the south side of the modern St. Peter's?

1629909729,Favorite Emperor and why?,"Let’s become nerds and explain our favorite emperor and why lol. Mine is Leo lll.

He was responsible for the defense of Constantinople during the second Arab siege (717–718). Although he had taken power only a few months before the blockade, he effectively followed the steps of Anastasios II (r. 713–715) and saved the empire. During this siege the Greek fire (hugron pur) was used, the Golden Horn was closed with a chain for the first time (at least it’s the first time it is mentioned in the primary sources), and Leo contacted Khan Tervel of Bulgaria, whose intervention was crucial. Constantinople would never again get besieged by the Arabs.
He repelled the Arab invasions of Anatolia that restarted in 726 and defeated them in the battle of Akroinon (740), one year before his own death, where he personally commanded the Byzantine troops along with his son and successor Constantine V. The battle was of significant importance, as it marked the end of the period when the empire struggled for its survival and ushered the frontier war—along with the crisis the Umayyad Caliphate faced, of course.
In 726, he published the Ecloga, a new legal code, in an attempt to rectify Justinian’s legislation. The Ecloga is influenced by the customary law, especially that of the East, as well as the Christian value of philanthropy. Thus, it gave more rights to women and children and replaced the death penalty with mutilation for a number of crimes.
He fought against corruption and tried to restore the power of the state. He decreed that judges should receive a substantial salary, in hopes that that would make them less susceptible to bribery. N. Oikonomides has also suggested that by bringing the apothekai under the direct control of the state he attempted to control and supervise the economy more closely rather than let private interests have their way (however, his theory that the kommerkiarioi of the apothekai were private entrepreneurs until the mid 8th century is controversial).
It seems that during his reign as well as that of his son the Byzantine economy recovered from the crisis of the 7th century (e.g. after 668 copper folles had disappeared) and was gradually re-monetized. Thus, the state could once again receive most taxes in gold rather than in kind, which by the way is generally considered on of the elements that make a country “advanced.” W. Brandes in his Finanzverwaltung in Krisenzeiten argues that the Isaurians played a vital role in reforming the Byzantine economy.",0,favorite emperor and why let s become nerd and explain our favorite emperor and why lol mine be leo lll he be responsible for the defense of constantinople during the second arab siege although he have take power only a few month before the blockade he effectively follow the step of anastasios ii and save the empire during this siege the greek fire hugron pur be use the golden horn be close with a chain for the first time at least it s the first time it be mention in the primary source and leo contact khan tervel of bulgaria whose intervention be crucial constantinople would never again get besiege by the arabs he repel the arab invasion of anatolia that restart in and defeat them in the battle of akroinon one year before his own death where he personally command the byzantine troop along with his son and successor constantine the battle be of significant importance a it marked the end of the period when the empire struggle for it survival and ushered the frontier with the crisis the umayyad caliphate face of course in he publish the ecloga a new legal code in an attempt to rectify justinian s legislation the ecloga be influence by the customary law especially that of the east a well a the christian value of philanthropy thus it give more right to woman and child and replace the death penalty with mutilation for a number of crime he fought against corruption and try to restore the power of the state he decreed that judge should receive a substantial salary in hope that that would make them less susceptible to bribery oikonomides have also suggest that by bring the apothekai under the direct control of the state he attempt to control and supervise the economy more closely rather than let private interest have their way however his theory that the kommerkiarioi of the apothekai be private entrepreneur until the mid century be controversial it seem that during his reign a well a that of his son the byzantine economy recover from the crisis of the century after copper folles have disappear and be gradually thus the state could once again receive most tax in gold rather than in kind which by the way be generally consider on of the element that make a country brandes in his finanzverwaltung in krisenzeiten argues that the isaurians played a vital role in reform the byzantine economy

1629680537,Voltaire on the growth of the church,"Excerpt from Voltaire's Philosophical Dictionary Volume III

""We have ample testimony in Origen, Athenagoras, Theophilus, Justin, and Tertullian, that the primitive Christians held temples and altars in abomination; and that not merely because they could not, in the beginning, obtain permission from the government to build temples, but because they had a real aversion for everything that seemed to apply any affinity with other religions. This abhorrence existed among them for two hundred and fifty years, as is proved by the following passage of Minutius Felix, who lived in the third century....

...The Christians, then, had no temples until about the beginning of the reign of Diocletian. The Church had then become very numerous; and it was found necessary to introduce those decorations and rites which, at an earlier period, would have been useless and even dangerous to a slender flock, long despised, and considered as nothing more than a small sect of dissenting Jews.

It is manifest that, while they were confounded with the Jews, they could not obtain permission to erect temples. The Jews, who paid very dear for their synagogues, would themselves have opposed it; for they were mortal enemies to the Christians, and they were rich. We must not say, with Toland, that the Christians, who at that time made a show of despising temples and altars, were like the fox that said the grapes were sour. This comparison appears as unjust as it is impious, since all the primitive Christians in so many different countries, agreed in maintaining that there was no need of raising temples or altars to the true God.

Providence, acting by second causes, willed that they should erect a splendid temple at Nicomedia, the residence of Emperor Diocletian, as soon as they had obtained that sovereign’s protection. They built others in other cities; but still, they had a horror of tapers, lustral water, pontifical habits, etc. All this pomp and circumstance was in their eyes no other than a distinctive mark of paganism. These customs were adopted under Constantine and his successors, and have frequently changed.

There is not, perhaps, a single ceremony of this day that was in use in the time of the apostles. The Holy Spirit has always conformed himself to the times. He inspired the first disciples in a mean apartment; He now communicates His inspirations in St. Peter’s at Rome, which cost several millions—equally divine, however, in the wretched room, and in the superb edifice of Julius II., Leo X., Paul III., and Sixtus V.",0,voltaire on the growth of the church excerpt from voltaire philosophical dictionary volume iii we have ample testimony in origen athenagoras theophilus justin and tertullian that the primitive christians held temple and altar in abomination and that not merely because they could not in the begin obtain permission from the government to build temple but because they have a real aversion for everything that seem to apply any affinity with other religion this abhorrence exist among them for two hundred and fifty year a be prove by the follow passage of minutius felix who live in the third century the christians then have no temple until about the begin of the reign of diocletian the church have then become very numerous and it be found necessary to introduce those decoration and rite which at an earlier period would have be useless and even dangerous to a slender flock long despise and consider a nothing more than a small sect of dissent jews it be manifest that while they be confound with the jews they could not obtain permission to erect temple the jews who paid very dear for their synagogue would themselves have oppose it for they be mortal enemy to the christians and they be rich we must not say with toland that the christians who at that time make a show of despise temple and altar be like the fox that say the grape be sour this comparison appear a unjust a it be impious since all the primitive christians in so many different country agree in maintain that there be no need of raise temple or altar to the true god providence act by second cause will that they should erect a splendid temple at nicomedia the residence of emperor diocletian a soon a they have obtain that sovereign s protection they built others in other city but still they have a horror of taper lustral water pontifical habit etc all this pomp and circumstance be in their eye no other than a distinctive mark of paganism these custom be adopt under constantine and his successor and have frequently change there be not perhaps a single ceremony of this day that be in use in the time of the apostle the holy spirit have always conform himself to the time he inspire the first disciple in a mean apartment he now communicates his inspiration in peter s at rome which cost several divine however in the wretched room and in the superb edifice of julius leo paul and sixtus v

1629338501,Resources to take in after (post) the fall of Rome?,"Hello! I have been in love with history for a short two years now. And though it hasn't been a long time, it has been a lot of fun. 

I have just finished Mike Duncan's ""The History of Rome"" and I loved it. Before that I finished most of Kings and Generals videos throughout the Republic, into the Empire and during the Fall. 

I love Mikes podcast because its a ""full"" history. It starts at the beginning and tries as hard as it can to touch upon, as much as possible, everything that was going on within the areas in and around Rome. This gives good context to what is going on within a time period and allows you to understand why people made the decisions they did. 

Sorry for the rant. I am looking for a history of Europe after the fall of Rome. How did we get from Rome to Charlemagne to Author the Great? What was going on in Eastern Europe and Northern Africa and Spain during these times? I know these times are dark and not a lot of history was written. 

I am looking for a timeline based history. Not small blimps of themes such as this movement or this battle. Also any video series on youtube or podcast or really any network. 

And really while I'm at it, I need another timeline based history podcast or video series to listen/watch. If you have anything else that starts at a date and runs through history to another far away date as thorough as The History of Rome please suggest it too. Anything before the 19th Century.

The list usually goes like this. 

* Remistus (*Avitus)*
* Flavius Ricimer (*Majorian, Severus, Anthemius, Olybrius,*)
* Flavius Gundobadus (*Olybrius, Glycerius*)
* Ecdicius Avitus (*Nepos*)
* Flavius Orestes (*Nepos*)

These men were the *de facto* head of government. When Valentinian gets killed, Petronius throws the whole empire into confusion. This was a perfect time for the Visigoths to try and put their preferred candidate in Ravenna and indeed they had a big role in it because they supported Eparchius Avitus, a military general in Gaul. 

Avitus's son, Ecdicius Avitus, would eventually serve also as magister militum under Nepos, an emperor with total support from Constantinople. But how and why Nepos switched Avitus for Orestes, I don't know. It could perhaps be that maybe Orestes just had more military experience and this was something Avitus didn't. 

Ideally, it could have been that Nepos would have liked to use Orestes' skills and diplomacy in taking down the Visigoths or perhaps the Vandals.",0,the office of magister militum after aetius the death of aetius give u a whole new period of rome the final closing chapter to the western empire the office of magister militum military master perhaps reach it height in the year after he die the list usually go like this remistus avitus flavius ricimer majorian severus anthemius olybrius flavius gundobadus olybrius glycerius ecdicius avitus nepos flavius orestes nepos these men be the de facto head of government when valentinian get kill petronius throw the whole empire into confusion this be a perfect time for the visigoths to try and put their prefer candidate in ravenna and indeed they have a big role in it because they support eparchius avitus a military general in gaul avitus son ecdicius avitus would eventually serve also a magister militum under nepos an emperor with total support from constantinople but how and why nepos switch avitus for orestes i do know it could perhaps be that maybe orestes just have more military experience and this be something avitus do ideally it could have be that nepos would have like to use orestes skill and diplomacy in take down the visigoths or perhaps the vandals

Plutarch criticizes the Athenian statesman Alcibiades for his infidelities with heterae during his marriage to Hipparete, which forced her to present herself in front of the archon for a divorce. While that is ancient greece, Plutarch did have influence as a historian in Rome. 

So: how did wives feel about infidelity, and were their feelings validated by contemporaries?",0,how do wife feel about infidelity how do men feel about the sexual double standard plautus and seneca both criticize the sexual double standard of their time and their be literary evidence to suggest that a husband s infidelity cause strife and could be a reason for her want a divorce in the roman empire i believe it be the infidelity of tullia s husband who be cicero s daughter that cause their marital discord plutarch criticizes the athenian statesman alcibiades for his infidelity with heterae during his marriage to hipparete which force her to present herself in front of the archon for a divorce while that be ancient greece plutarch do have influence a a historian in rome so how do wife feel about infidelity and be their feeling validate by contemporary

1629138222,Upset about Pompeii,"I’m just going to say that I’m upset. For the first time in my life I studied a good bit about Pompeii, and I compared the early photos with the most recent ones, and also the recent photos with the watercolors made just after the excavations more than 100 years ago. Well, most of the paintings and original colors disappeared. Sometimes, even plaster did. The beautiful pristine status is gone. I’m beating a dead horse, I know, but what a pity!

Also, most of the victims casts, objects and furniture were brought into museums. No accurate record of original positions exist (or it’s very hard to find).

So Pompeii is now mostly similar to any other ancient ruins site (say, the forum in Rome). Humanity had a unique chance, and botched it. Lots of features are lost forever. It’s a huge site and the excavations began before the inception of archeology itself, but alas, we couldn’t imagine anything better than stripping and leaving the walls to rot? What about at least providing some roofing to the most recent houses? Or, *displacing* a whole house into a climatized museum, replacing it on site with a replica? These seem blasphemous ideas, but good grief, they’re better than letting *everything* but the stone disappear in another century!

1628898569,Is learning Italian first the best basis for Moving onto other Romance Languages? Also is Italian (or the various languages of Italy) the closest of the modern Romance family to Latin?,"I was told by a few multilingual language that Italian gives a basic middle ground between all the romance language in that for example while a Spaniard will understand a lot of Portuguese easily without any prior study,  he'd have a much harder time with French and won't understand most Romanian basics.

Italian on the otherhand not only has a lot of similar pronunciation to Spanish in addition to word but also shares a lot in common with French structure and in addition was deemed on a quick google to be the closest language to Romanian of the Romance family. And its a big help plenty and plenty of other romance languages such as Sicilian are within the modern Italian borders and islands nearby Italy as well as also in regions cross Spain like Catalan and various islands and port locations in the Mediterranean that were major trading hubs dominated by Italian merchants in the Medieval Ages.

So plenty of people tell me Italian is the best starting point as a result of being in the absolute center ground if you plan to specialize in romance languages. And its a big help that Italy is the capital of Catholicism and most cultures with Romance tongues are primarily Catholic and that Italy is one of the economic superpowers of modern times.

It is all for this reason I was also told that Italian is the closest to Latin of the existing Romance languages in their current form. So I was told specialize in Italian first if you intend to go deep into Ancient Roman studies because its the closest (and it does't help Italy is where the Roman Empire's heartland was so you'd have to learn it anyway if you start Latin language as a hobby).

1628358358,Child emperors post-Julian was the worst thing Rome did,"When Julian takes office. You get this breath of fresh air. Its like Rome has a real emperor again, he behaves like a princeps and reminds the people of Rome the virtue of their forefathers and of the sacrificed to Jupiter Optimus Maximus. 

After him, you either have a brute autocrat or an idiot child guided by a barbarian chief or unscrupulous regent. The truth is that by that time, Rome should have just culturally incorporated the Goths and Vandals into the emperorship. Somebody like Stilico should have been emperor in the same way Thrax did. 

I often look back and wonder how the Roman people fell in love with Alexander and the child Gordian. These were the last two child emperors before a long series of military leaders. This child emperor thing should have ended in the third century. The fact that it came back is just ridiculous. 

If I was a Roman citizen and heard that Gratian died and general Magnus Maximus has been elevated to Augustus, I would be thrilled. I would cheer him on to eliminate the rest of the Valentinians. 

You also have that brief period when Honorius dies and an actual stable adult man becomes Augustus again, but he is immediately removed and another child emperor is thrown in. 

Finally, the empire manages to get some semblance of stability when Julius Nepos takes over and becomes an official recognized emperor.  It's now been about twenty years since Rome had a child emperor. This was the ideal time for the empire to catch its breath and slowly recover. 

Gundobad had been succeeded by Orestes as magister militum and this is when that whole rebellion starts and poor little Julian flees to Dalmatia. 

This was nothing new. A magister militum taking power over the emperor? Lets recall how the Praetorian prefects used their power whenever they had a weak emperor. 

But what I think is interesting is that he chose to put another child as emperor. After twenty or so years of Rome having adult men with government experience as emperors, Orestes decides to put his infant son as emperor. 

I'm pretty sure that Odoacer, seeing all of this, thought ""enough is enough"". He could have simply usurped the office of Magister Militum and behave like Ricimer and Gundobad did to some weak ceremonial emperor. But honestly the man just wanted to get his troops paid and had enough of theatrics. 

If say, for example, Orestes wife paid him off and made him magister militum to her son Augustulus in Ravenna. Then you would have that whole shitshow all over again. I think he was right in deposing the emperor. We can't have Rome turn too much into a spectacle of a state.",0,child emperor be the bad thing rome do when julian take office you get this breath of fresh air its like rome have a real emperor again he behaves like a princeps and reminds the people of rome the virtue of their forefather and of the sacrifice to jupiter optimus maximus after him you either have a brute autocrat or an idiot child guide by a barbarian chief or unscrupulous regent the truth be that by that time rome should have just culturally incorporate the goths and vandals into the emperorship somebody like stilico should have be emperor in the same way thrax do i often look back and wonder how the roman people fell in love with alexander and the child gordian these be the last two child emperor before a long series of military leader this child emperor thing should have end in the third century the fact that it come back be just ridiculous if i be a roman citizen and heard that gratian die and general magnus maximus have be elevate to augustus i would be thrill i would cheer him on to eliminate the rest of the valentinians you also have that brief period when honorius dy and an actual stable adult man becomes augustus again but he be immediately remove and another child emperor be thrown in finally the empire manages to get some semblance of stability when julius nepos take over and becomes an official recognize emperor it now be about twenty year since rome have a child emperor this be the ideal time for the empire to catch it breath and slowly recover gundobad have be succeed by orestes a magister militum and this be when that whole rebellion start and poor little julian flees to dalmatia this be nothing new a magister militum take power over the emperor lets recall how the praetorian prefect use their power whenever they have a weak emperor but what i think be interest be that he chose to put another child a emperor after twenty or so year of rome have adult men with government experience a emperor orestes decides to put his infant son a emperor i pretty sure that odoacer see all of this thought enough be enough he could have simply usurped the office of magister militum and behave like ricimer and gundobad do to some weak ceremonial emperor but honestly the man just want to get his troop paid and have enough of theatrics if say for example orestes wife paid him off and make him magister militum to her son augustulus in ravenna then you would have that whole shitshow all over again i think he be right in depose the emperor we ca have rome turn too much into a spectacle of a state

1627843727,Traveling in the empire for the best festivals,"You have money to throw away, your friend Marcellus and Paulus has a ship parked out in Ostia, they say they want to have some fun and travel the empire to go festival hopping.

Tarentum is a great city in the empire and the Festival of Dionysius there was among one of the most famous due to the party atmosphere of the Tarentines. They're practically rivaling Neapolis at this point...

Over in Magnesia, you have the Hetaerideia, a festival dedicated to Aphrodite Hetaera, where the prostitutes dine and sing for the whole town and go home with the men. 

But while you're in Greece, you don't want to miss the Panathenaic festival in Athens, by far one of the best festivals ever. Everybody who is anybody will be there and you surely don't want to miss the rhapsody competition, the Pyrrhic dances, the torch relay race, and the best of all, the boat races. How can you miss this event? To say nothing of all the after parties that happen afterward.

Let's cross the Aegean because we also don't want to miss Artemisia over in Ephesus. Pliny himself was blown away by this festival and everybody travels there to see the great theatrical performances and the magnificent artistic renditions of Artemis who is paraded throughout the streets.

You want to keep traveling, Paulus wants to go to the splendid island of Samos for the Heraia but Marcellus wants to go to Alexandria for the Serapia, the festival of Serapis. Everybody runs around the city and celebrates Serapis as well as Anubis and you see great statues and costumes of this unique Greco-Egyptian culture. There are also great comedic performances since the Alexandrines certainly are witty people.

When it comes to winter festivals, you decide to ditch Rome, it's getting way too touristy. Nobody really hangs out in Rome during Saturnalia anymore, we're not in the days of Cato. Everybody is heading south now and you go down to Sicily and city hop between Catania and Syracuse, only a short boat ride away and the weather is much better. Those two beautiful cities that Decimus Ausonius once called the only two cities in Sicily.

But perhaps it will be a good idea to attend the fire festival of Belenus up in Aquilea? Hmmm... it's not something popular and there is great beauty up in the Cisalpine Gaul with its delicious wine.

1627481402,How was population of Roman Italy during Republican period so large compared to other civilizations in mediterranean that were even more developed than Italy?,"It's well known that one key to the Roman Republic's success in wars and in terms of their imperial expansion (most notably in the wars against Carthage) was that they were able to leverage enormous manpower reserves from almost all of Italy. 

Now while I understand that Rome's network of alliances throughout the peninsula allowed the city-state to tap into man reserves from many other city-states on the peninsula, that still doesn't answer the question as to how that Italian peninsula itself had such a seemingly large population relative to other mediterranean nations. 

For example, there were times when Ancient Greece was unified under alliance regimes or under Macedonian control for example. Egypt under the Ptolemies had a huge population. Persian empires had huge populations. 

How was it that Italy had so many people compared to these more ancient, and more developed/urbanized regions in the Eastern Mediterranean?  **Did** Italy actually have an enormous population or was it simply that all free males had a habit of military service whereas the military utilization rate was just far lower in all other contemporary civilizations?

He was the mayor of Rome, *prefectus urbanus*, during the time of the elder Valentinian. This man had a lot of work to do. Mind you, 4th century Rome is no picnic. 

The old Pons Agrippae over the Tiber had been destroyed and he repaired so that the citizens can easily cross that region of the city once more. He made sure that the food supply was always good and was also a religious man who made sacrifices to the gods. 

During his term, his loyal friend, Praetextus, and other magistrates mounted the Capitoline in old Roman fashion and made sacrifices to the ancient gods. He took care that vestal virgins continue their tradition. 

Some of the plebs, however, hated him due to his frugality, a characteristic of Roman virtue, and decided to burn his house down because he would not lower the price of limes. He fled the city for a while and spend his time in writing and creative projects only to return by the Senate. 

Upon his return, he continued his term and the plebs that were involved in the burning of his house were punished. He later became consul and was also a good father, his son, Aurelius Symmachus, was one of the last true Romans to stand up to the Christianization of the empire.",0,avianius symmachus one of rome last great mayor avianus symmachus be a senator and come from a distinguish family he be the mayor of rome prefectus urbanus during the time of the elder valentinian this man have a lot of work to do mind you century rome be no picnic the old pons agrippae over the tiber have be destroyed and he repair so that the citizen can easily cross that region of the city once more he make sure that the food supply be always good and be also a religious man who make sacrifice to the god during his term his loyal friend praetextus and other magistrate mount the capitoline in old roman fashion and make sacrifice to the ancient god he take care that vestal virgin continue their tradition some of the pleb however hat him due to his frugality a characteristic of roman virtue and decide to burn his house down because he would not low the price of lime he flee the city for a while and spend his time in write and creative project only to return by the senate upon his return he continued his term and the pleb that be involve in the burning of his house be punish he later become consul and be also a good father his son aurelius symmachus be one of the last true romans to stand up to the christianization of the empire

1627163297,Would an Aurelian film be too edgy for society?,"I still haven't figured out why there hasn't been a large production focusing on the crisis of the third century. It's such an epic age. From the time of Marcus Philippus to Aurelian, its just chaos after chaos. Plus that 1,000 year old anniversary as well as the Persian capture of Valerian would make one big cinematic adventure. 

But as far as a protagonist goes. We have admirable men in Claudius Gothicus and Aurelian. A splendid tragedy, really. Why hasn't this been done? Is it too edgy for our modern society? 

Barbarians came out on Netflix and that was an excellent series. Gladiator, despite its flaws, wowed audiences. And, of course, you have Ben Hur and other such films.

In Shakespeare's age, people likewise admired the Julio-Claudians and Shakespeare wrote plays based on Julius Caesar and Mark Antony and his contemporary, Ben Jonson, wrote one on Sejanus. 

You also see this in the 1700s when people would attend operas that took place in Ancient Rome. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed an opera based on Titus and one based on Sulla, even though such operas were quite silly and had focused on love stories. There was also operas based on Scipio Africanus and Aetius that premiered in London composed by Händel. 

So its not like we are the only ones who admire the Romans. Think of how many people fell in love with Ben Hur when it came out back in the day. 

So why not a splendid biopic or grand production of Rome in the age of Aurelian? Is this time just way too edgy?",0,would an aurelian film be too edgy for society i still have figure out why there have be a large production focus on the crisis of the third century it such an epic age from the time of marcus philippus to aurelian it just chaos after chaos plus that year old anniversary a well a the persian capture of valerian would make one big cinematic adventure but a far a a protagonist go we have admirable men in claudius gothicus and aurelian a splendid tragedy really why have this be do is it too edgy for our modern society barbarians come out on netflix and that be an excellent series gladiator despite it flaw wowed audience and of course you have ben hur and other such film in shakespeare age people likewise admire the and shakespeare write play base on julius caesar and mark antony and his contemporary ben jonson write one on sejanus you also see this in the when people would attend opera that take place in ancient rome wolfgang amadeus mozart compose an opera base on titus and one base on sulla even though such opera be quite silly and have focus on love story there be also opera base on scipio africanus and aetius that premier in london compose by händel so it not like we be the only one who admire the romans think of how many people fell in love with ben hur when it come out back in the day so why not a splendid biopic or grand production of rome in the age of aurelian is this time just way too edgy

Later on, we see Caesar doing something similar to Pompey, by giving him his daughter Julia in marriage. I can go on and on, Cato did it, Cicero did it, etc.... 

In short, you would always have these men of distinction bestowing their daughters on each other. Was this why all the young men who were single were seeing courtesans?

1626572204,The Greatest Roman Leader,"I have thought about this for a while, and I believe the greatest leader in the entirety of the Roman empire (atleast the western empire) was Octavian Caesar Augustus. He is the greatest because he was able to manipulate the Roman public into believing he was ruling over Rome as a elected official but he was an emperor and he began the shift into emporors commanding Rome. Augustus is also the greatest because he introduced the idea of having Auxilaries in the roman empire who historians believe was one of the greatest policies ever made in the ancient world. The ability to serve the roman empire for a set amount of time and retire as a roman citizen with money, land, and a community was unbeatable. Augustus also did many other great things for Rome and the world.

1626126117,How did beards go out of style again?,"We typically think of the first beardless period ranging from the time of Scipio Africanus up to Trajan's time. Then you have Hadrian and Antoninus with beards and this continues more or less into the time of the Tetrarchy. 

Some people say it was Constantine that brought the shaved look again and it is indeed interesting to see how his successors also didn't sport a beard, except Julian. 

But once those two crazy brothers go up and split the empire again, you pretty much have a beardless imperial court. 

But the thing is that all those old Christian writers still had beards. They liked having beards, maybe it made them feel more saintly or like a wise philosopher or something. At any rate, you dont see the magister militums doing this either. They were clean shaven. 

How did this happen? Why didn't the imperial court support beards?",0,how do beard go out of style again we typically think of the first beardless period range from the time of scipio africanus up to trajan time then you have hadrian and antoninus with beard and this continue more or less into the time of the tetrarchy some people say it be constantine that brought the shave look again and it be indeed interest to see how his successor also do sport a beard except julian but once those two crazy brother go up and split the empire again you pretty much have a beardless imperial court but the thing be that all those old christian writer still have beard they like have beard maybe it make them feel more saintly or like a wise philosopher or something at any rate you dont see the magister militums do this either they be clean shaven how do this happen why do the imperial court support beard

However I don’t understand why Gallienus is to blame for this. In the context of the era, Gallienus was constantly running around one end of the empire having to simultaneously fight off massive barbarian invasions and put down innumerable usurpers, the whole state was in shambles and the empire almost looked like it was on its last legs. Yet Gallienus managed to hold on by the skin of his teeth. I find it odd that even after already helping save Rome from multiple possible disasters, he was criticised because two of the dozens of usurpers managed to break away. I think he did pretty well considering everything he was up against. So why didn’t the Romans take this into account?",0,why be gallienus perceive unfavourably by roman historian i be reading about the reign of gallienus during the crisis of the century and found out that he be not view positively by roman who write about him supposedly because under his reign the empire lose land to the breakaway state of the gallic empire in the west and the palmyrene empire in the east however i don t understand why gallienus be to blame for this in the context of the era gallienus be constantly run around one end of the empire have to simultaneously fight off massive barbarian invasion and put down innumerable usurper the whole state be in shamble and the empire almost look like it be on it last leg yet gallienus manage to hold on by the skin of his teeth i find it odd that even after already help save rome from multiple possible disaster he be criticise because two of the dozen of usurper manage to break away i think he do pretty well consider everything he be up against so why didn t the romans take this into account

1625442143,The Fall of the Western Empire re-interpreted as 751 AD,"We are often more familiar with the Western Empire once Attila fell. The years between 453-476. The murder of Valentinian, Vandal Invasion, Majorian's campaigns, etc...

But emperor Marcian and Aspar, despite breaking the Hunnic confederacy had a whole different situation going on for them. They had the Saracens and mighty Persia to their east. This was a place that had done many horrors to Rome, there was also Armenia to worry about and so they decided to focus on having better legions for a war against Persia and had the Ostrogoths and other tribes secure the Danubian frontier and granted them the title of Foederatii. 

Meanwhile, the temples were being taken down and the old classical world was coming to an end. His shrewd austerity gave the empire a large surplus of money, however. 

When Valentinian III died and Petronius Maximus took power in Rome, Marcian did not recognize him and both halves of the empire became divided more and more. But Marcian eventually died and Aspar was once again able to play kingmaker and so general Leo was chosen and he became Augustus in 457. This time the coronation was different and many Christian elements and sayings were added furthering transforming Constantinople into the ""Byzantine Empire"" we come to think of. 

But Leo still had to deal with the Huns, just cause Attila died doesn't mean the Huns disappeared. What about the Sarmatians? For this he had the Ostrogothic leader, Theoderic fight the Danubian tribes. Not only that but he was able to have Anthemius become Augustus in the West. Rome was back to being more united. 

With Attila gone, the western court was back to focusing on its two main problems; the Rhine border, the Visigoths, and the Vandals. In the Eastern court, Leo had killed Aspar, but in the western court, Ricimer killed Anthemius. Ravenna was increasingly slipping. 

He promoted one of his close friends, Julius Nepos to become the next emperor. By this time Ricimer was dead and his successor Gundobad wasn't as imposing on the western emperor, Glycerius, who readily abdicated when Nepos landed in Italy to become the next Augustus. However, this would not last long because he got into a disagreement with his general, Orestes, who took power and forced Nepos to flee to Dalmatia.

After Leo, Zeno the Isaurian, became emperor and, yet he had to deal with the revolt and usurpation of Basiliscus who took power in Constantinople. Already we have a de facto usurpation in the east and west.  

Finally, the city of Cosntantinople couldn't take the rule of Basiliscus and opened the city gates to the deposed Zeno and restored him to power. just as he was informed that over in Italy, there was a disagreement over Nepos and one of his generals, Orestes and that he had to flee to Dalmatia for fear of his life and that one of the Ostrogothic foederatii chiefs, Odoacer, deposed the usurper's son Augustulus and demanded the payment and lands that they were owed. 

Unable to handle many things at once, he granted Odoacer the title of *dux* but tried to have him recognize Nepos as the emperor, a bit like how things were back in Ricimer's days. 

But this didn't happen and Nepos eventually died not too long after. But Zeno had bigger things to worry about. There were so many non-foederati barbarians still running around that it's better to have an Ostrogothic be honorary king of Italy than to have rampaged by a more barbaric group. After that he sided with Theoderic, the darling of old emperor Leo who was brave at defending Rome's borders. 

He finally took Italy back through the help of Theodoric and this ushered in the rebuilding of many of Rome's old buildings as well as improving Ravenna. The court of Constantinople likewise became to flourish again after Anastasius became Augustus. 

In fact, Theodoric likewise became king of the Visigoths, uniting an empire stretching from Pannonia to Spain. To Zeno and Anastasius, this was still their realm. The Goths also hated the Vandals so this brought more animosity between Ravenna and Constantinople. 

It's only after Theoderic dies that this Gothic solidarity breaks and the Ostrogothic court in Ravenna start descending into disorder. The western provinces were becoming 'too problematic' and they had to be retaken no matter at what costs from those officers who technically were considered foederati but who have become sworn enemies. 

This is when Carthage becomes the Praetorian Prefect of Africa, it is back under Roman rule. In Italy, Ravenna becomes the capital city of the Praetorian Prefect of Italy. 

But remember the Gepids? Those people who were foederati's way back in Marcian's days? Those same Gepids rebelled against the Huns and protected the frontiers from invaders? Those people were eventually attacked by a new enemy, the Lombards. 

But these ""enemies"" were men who Justinian recruited in the reconquest of Italy from the Ostrogoths. Now the Lombards are making advances in Italy but by this time, the east was way too focused on other enemies, it lost Africa to the Muslims and Italy wasn't taken too seriously because of the incursions from Slavs, Avars, as well as the Sassanids right next door. 

Back in the old days we had the Visigoths, the Western Empire, and the Vandals, now we have The Rashidun, the Franks, and the Lombards. All of what remained in Constantinople's holding were Sicily and the southern portions of Italy. For me, this makes it seem like a more official collapse of the west.",0,the fall of the western empire a ad we be often more familiar with the western empire once attila fell the year between the

1625154943,Do you think Byzantine imperial succession was smoother and more stable than Roman imperial succession?,"I know Byzantine is Roman but I feel the medieval remnant was more stable in terms of succession than Roman Classical era.

Once I began studying the Byzantine Emperors more in depth I realized that they actually had a “informal but formal” plan for succession that was more more dynastic and hereditary than previous Emperors.

Even when I only knew very little about Roman Empire, the Byzantine always seemed more successful and it looks they actually had a proper established succession process, yes usurpations, coups, Familicide, and over throughs still happen but overall Byzantine seems more akin to other Dark Age monarchs with a royal court and a hereditary monarchy.

When we get to the Antonines, however, we see that the city has many people and they enjoy the circus races, performances in the amphitheater, and trade with the various peoples from the empire.

The city became a jewel for the rebellious usurpers of the third century. A rich city like Trier was to become a capital. Despite the usurpers coming to an end and Diocletian restoring order, there was no way that he would just shrug away this important city. He decided to likewise make it capital and when Constantine became emperor, he made this city all the more spectacular and made it the most important city north of Alps. This beautiful city became the residence of Constantius II, Magnus Maximus, Gratian, and also the birthplace of Ambrosius. 

Of course, the city of Arles in the south also received great recognition and the Constantines likewise favored it. When the time came that the Rhine frontier was too weak, the capital of the prefecture of Gaul was transferred from Trier to Arles. The usurper Constantine who co-ruled with Honorius, likewise knew that Trier was too unstable a city to be his capital and so he made Arles the seat of his government. 

At this time, Ravenna was also gaining prominence while Milan was still likewise quite strong. When we get to the assassination of Valentinian III, the city of Arles still holds strong and soon becomes a metropolitan archdiocese. Up in the north, the Franks have already taken over much of Gaul and the city of Trier was held by Count Arbogast who was a more Romanized Frank than his counterparts. 

Arles, on the other hand, was still around but it was becoming more and more separated from Italy. The Burgundians, Visigoths, and Franks made it too liable to Gallic forces. Eventually, a Gallic Roman officer named Avitus would be proclaimed Augustus in this city and it slowly became more and more detached from Italy. 

The emperor Anthemius, the puppet of Ricimer, just couldn't let this happen, he saw how powerful the Visigoths were becoming, but it was too late. The city of Arles was captured, Anthemius's son was killed, and the Romans lost complete control of southern Gaul. All that was left was Egidius up in the north trying to protect himself against multiple enemies. 

Later on, Arles was captured by the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy, but this likewise eventually gave way to the Franks.

1624661686,Why did the ancient writers love trashing people in their books?,"Have you noticed that? These guys just love trashing folks. 

Cassius Dio and Tacitus seem to do it a lot. Particularly when relating to previous Roman politicians of the past. They are not afraid to be poignant in their attacks too. 

Meaning that you get many Romans attacking other Romans but they do this all the time towards imperial administrators as well. Everybody just hates Narcissus, the eunuch of Claudius. I think he's great. Check out this passage from Dio. 

"" But finally, when he \[Claudius\] went down to Ostia to inspect the grain supply and she \[Messalina\] was left behind in Rome on the pretext of being ill, she got up a banquet of no little renown and carried on a most licentious revel. Then Narcissus, having got Claudius by himself, informed him through his concubines of all that was taking place.""

Like at one point I'm reading Livy's descriptions of the most iconic Roman battles but then you also have these little palace intrigues that occur later. The historians seem keener on idolizing the past and scandalizing the present and the overall post-Augustan age in general. 

The whole Claudius episode just feels like one big soap opera sometimes. 

As far as the later historians go, you definitely get a lot of shade from Zosimus and Ammianus. Herodian not so much. But then when you get to Procopius, its all shade again. 

In fact, the ancient writers always seem to speak in a way that they just blurt out their opinions. Why was this the case?

1624557861,"Why is the Roman Legion generally seen as superior to their opponents in every way? Considering biased patriotic Roman historians such as Livy and Vegetius frequently pointed out the glaring flaws of the Roman military, how did this stereotype come to be?","Livy said:
&gt;Victory in war does not depend entirely upon numbers or mere courage; only skill and discipline will insure it. We find that the Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps and unwearied cultivation of the other arts of war. Without these, what chance would the inconsiderable numbers of the Roman armies have had against the multitudes of the Gauls? Or with what success would their small size have been opposed to the prodigious stature of the Germans? The Spaniards surpassed us not only in numbers, but in physical strength. We were always inferior to the Africans in wealth and unequal to them in deception and stratagem. And the Greeks, indisputably, were far superior to us in skill in arts and all kinds of knowledge.

&gt;But to all these advantages the Romans opposed unusual care in the choice of their levies and in their military training. They thoroughly understood the importance of hardening them by continual practice, and of training them to every maneuver that might happen in the line and in action. Nor were they less strict in punishing idleness and sloth. The courage of a soldier is heightened by his knowledge of his profession, and he only wants an opportunity to execute what he is convinced he has been perfectly taught. A handful of men, inured to war, proceed to certain victory, while on the contrary numerous armies of raw and undisciplined troops are but multitudes of men dragged to slaughter.

I notice the Romans are always seen as invincible and superior their opponents in every way. Like the quote by Livy above, the Romans weren't exactly the perfect army in military abilities, tactics, and strategies. In fact much of the time the Romans were outmatched in many essential areas!Roman Legions were often inferior to their opponents in many essential fields such as quality of weapons,physical conditioning of soldier,numbers, skill of individual warriors, thickness of armor, quality of weapons!For example take armor and weapons. Generally history books make it seem that Romans had the most advanced armor and weaponry in Europe and their opponents often fought with poor armor. But if one researches the enemies the Romans fought, often they had armor and weaponry as heavy as those the Romans had especially some of the more vicious Germanic tribes of the post Pax Romana such as the Visigoths and the Franks!! And the Romans weren't master of tactics and strategies like history books make it out to be. Often when they fought in North Africa and in the Middle East particularly against the Sassanids, the Roman tactical and strategical abilities were significantly inferior to those of their enemies even down right foolish at times. And history books always make the Romans seem like they were masters of siege weaponry and engineering. If one reads , often the siege equipment the Romans used were no better than those of their enemies.

Aside from tactical training, logistics and tenacity in waging wars on strategic level they were average to at most good in many different fields and traits but not the best. Roman Soldiers were less zelous than Jews. They were less physically imposing than Germanic tribes. Roman officers and generals were less brilliant than those of their Greeks. Even their famous resources were matched by their enemies particularly the Sassanids. Carthage, Macedonia, Ptolemaic Egypt, the Seleucid Empire and other Mediterranean powers had comparable technology, social and economic development to the Roman Republic.

In fact whatever tactics,strategies, and equipment the Romans used that were incredibly effective were copied by their enemies!For example Carthage had adopted basic Roman formations and heavy infantry in their armies. When they fought the Romans their equipment was equal to those of the Romans and they used similar formations. The Sassanids were quick to create shock infantry that were heavily armored once they saw the Roman Legions hacked through their regular infantry thus the Sassanids became on par with the Romans in armory and weaponry. Heck Romans armies have time and again been easily defeated by villagers of nations they invaded. Plus their enemies training were as equally grueling as their own! Just research the training of the Sassanid Armies and the . Additionally the Roman Legions even admitted that the Sassanids as skilled as they were in war.

In fact, the Romans themselves admit there were serious deficiencies in their armed forces. Tacitus for instance gives the game away. When the the legions in Germania and Pannonia mutiny upon hearing the death of Augustus, he simply dismisses the causes as being essentially the same as usual.

Why are the Romans always made out to be the most superior army in every in the Classical Age including in weaponry,armor, and strategies and tactics? Practically every big primary source on Roman history from Appian to Tacitus and esp the quoted Livy not only pointed out the weaknesses of the Roman mlitary and enemy superiority in many elements but even write about mutinies in the Legions, backstabbing, desertion in battle, and other stuff about the Roman Army! So how did this come to be?",0,why be the roman legion generally see a superior to their opponent in every way considering bias patriotic roman historian such a livy and vegetius frequently point out the glare flaw of the roman military how do this stereotype come to be livy say gt victory in war do not depend entirely upon number or mere courage only skill and discipline will insure it we find that the romans owe the conquest of the world to no other cause than continual military training exact observance of discipline in their camp and unwearied cultivation of the other art of war without these what chance would the inconsiderable number of the roman army have have against the multitude of the gauls or with what success would their small size have be oppose to the prodigious stature of the germans the spaniards surpass u not only in number but in physical strength we be always inferior to the africans in wealth and unequal to them in deception and stratagem and the greeks indisputably be far superior to u in skill in art and all kind of knowledge gt but to all these advantage the romans oppose unusual care in the choice of their levy and in their military training they thoroughly understood the importance of harden them by continual practice and of training them to every maneuver that might happen in the line and in action nor be they less strict in punish idleness and sloth the courage of a soldier be heighten by his knowledge of his profession and he only want an opportunity to execute what he be convince he have be perfectly taught a handful of men inure to war proceed to certain victory while on the contrary numerous army of raw and undisciplined troop be but multitude of men drag to slaughter i notice the romans be always see a invincible and superior their opponent in every way like the quote by livy above the romans be exactly the perfect army in military ability tactic and strategy in fact much of the time the romans be outmatch in many essential area roman legions be often inferior to their opponent in many essential field such a quality of weapon physical conditioning of soldier number skill of individual warrior thickness of armor quality of weapon for example take armor and weapon generally history book make it seem that romans have the most advanced armor and weaponry in europe and their opponent often fought with poor armor but if one research the enemy the romans fought often they have armor and weaponry a heavy a those the romans have especially some of the more vicious germanic tribe of the post pax romana such a the visigoths and the franks and the romans be master of tactic and strategy like history book make it out to be often when they fought in north africa and in the middle east particularly against the sassanids the roman tactical and strategical ability be significantly inferior to those of their enemy even down right foolish at time and history book always make the romans seem like they be master of siege weaponry and engineering if one read often the siege equipment the romans use be no well than those of their enemy aside from tactical training logistics and tenacity in wag war on strategic level they be average to at most good in many different field and trait but not the best roman soldiers be less zelous than jews they be less physically impose than germanic tribe roman officer and general be less brilliant than those of their greeks even their famous resource be match by their enemy particularly the sassanids carthage macedonia ptolemaic egypt the seleucid empire and other mediterranean power have comparable technology social and economic development to the roman republic in fact whatever tactic strategy and equipment the romans use that be incredibly effective be copy by their enemy for example carthage have adopt basic roman formation and heavy infantry in their army when they fought the romans their equipment be equal to those of the romans and they use similar formation the sassanids be quick to create shock infantry that be heavily armored once they saw the roman legions hack through their regular infantry thus the sassanids become on par with the romans in armory and weaponry heck romans army have time and again be easily defeat by villager of nation they invade plus their enemy training be a equally grueling a their own just research the training of the sassanid armies and the additionally the roman legions even admit that the sassanids a skilled a they be in war in fact the romans themselves admit there be serious deficiency in their arm force tacitus for instance give the game away when the the legion in germania and pannonia mutiny upon hearing the death of augustus he simply dismisses the cause a be essentially the same a usual why be the romans always make out to be the most superior army in every in the classical age include in weaponry armor and strategy and tactic practically every big primary source on roman history from appian to tacitus and esp the quote livy not only point out the weakness of the roman mlitary and enemy superiority in many element but even write about mutiny in the legions backstabbing desertion in

Apparently Cassus Dio implies that Augustus prevented Crassus from this honor by reading an inscription in the temple by a man named Cossus, but I’m not sure how that is related.

I'm new to ancient history and specifically learning about Ancient Rome; the Mike Duncan podcast sucked me in, and now I'm ready to dig deeper.

I will be reading a physical book; not an audiobook, and not a Kindle. I really like footnotes, references, glossaries, and all that associated supplemental material.

I want to start with the founding; and can't decide between one of the ""easier"" translations of Livy (Warrior, maybe?) or one of the other ancient historians, or maybe even Everitt's ""Rise of Rome"" which seems much easier. I don't want to get too bogged down in difficult texts, but I do want to read good scholarship and get the ""real"" story.

I also want to make sure that whichever book I choose will leave off at a point close to where some other book starts!

I would appreciate any ideas or advice.

1622929147,Tarentum: Its disunity and surrender to Rome,"A rich and powerful city, Tarentum had two political parties, the Democrats and the Aristocrats. They had a strong naval capacity. The other Greek cities admired Tarentum as it proved to be a jewel of a city in the center of the Mediterranean.

But their men preferred the art of trade than of arms and this led them to use mercenaries. The Lucanians above them to would raid their lands and they likewise viewed the Samnites as barbarians. After all, Tarentum is the city of Archytes and of a flourishing trade capital with the highest monarchs of the east. 

What were the Romans doing? Cultivating more weapons, training in the Campus Martius, and attempting to curtail the power of their northern neighbors, the Etruscans. 

The Tarentines were tired and instead of fighting their enemies in the north, they kept asking other powers to help them. The Spartan kings helped them but lost, then Alexander Molossus helped them but was also brutally killed by the Lucanians as Livy and other historians relate. 

In short, the Tarentines, sooner or later, were bound to come in contact with Rome. Once the Lucanians were defeated by Rome, they established trade relations with their new neighbor, wishing to implement a restriction in the gulf of Tarentum so that they can continue implementing their business without foreign competition, after all, they have been around longer.

But they kept squabbling and this enabled Rome to use its influence on the pro-Roman party, the Aristocrats. The population got more divided, several cities in Apulia and Bruttium were helped by Rome, which irritated the Tarentines. When a Roman ship was found in their waters, they attacked it and this provoked the Senate. 

They then sent a diplomat, Postumius, to visit the city and talk things over. As usual, the Tarentines treated the Roman envoy with hostility and Philonides, the party leader, did not do anything when Postumius was mistreated by the Tarentine people in his experience there. 

The Tarentines didn't care if they offended the Romans. They felt themselves safe and secure because they were friends and trading partners with strong leaders. Sparta, Epirus, Corinth, Macedon, etc... 

The Romans knew that to declare a war on a state with a powerful friends would be challenging but they did it anyways. After all, many of the other Greek cities in Magna Graecia did not like the Tarentines and thought that Rome, although Latin, would better serve their interests. 

Tarentum again feels like it can't do this alone and invites Pyrrhus to help them. Just like they invited Sparta, Molossus, Agathocles, etc... except this time, their fate was sealed. 

Rome had the aid of Carthage, of Sicily, and of the various Italic tribes that likewise despised Tarentum. Pyrrhus tried, failed, and abandoned the campaign.

A few years ago I remember hearing that the role of the father in the family as the ultimate authority was considered so sacred in ancient Roman society that if a father killed his children, that was considered a family affair and the state would not interfere. 

Furthermore, I also heard that this happened to at least one emperor (i.e. the father who was not an emperor killed his son who was an emperor and society was like: ""Well he's the father so he has the right to kill his children if he wants""). I assume this was an exaggerating, but I don't remember exactly where I heard it and have not found it again. Is there any credence to this story at all? Was the role of the father so sacred that he could kill his children and it was considered a family affair that the state would not interfere with?

This second movement is not described as a rotation again, but more like the movement of single cohortes and manipuli - something like breaking the original column and reforming it in a different way, now with the traditional order of hastati-principes-triarii.

Is anybody familiar with this kind of maneuvers? Could you add some details or links to references? I think I grasped the general sense of the whole thing, but I’m not 100% sure.
