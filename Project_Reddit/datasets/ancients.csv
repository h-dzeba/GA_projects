1642457499,What was the point of all that bulky bronze armour when all it did was clang against you after it gets stabbed through and you fall?,"&amp;#x200B;

[I am reading the Iliad, and in chapter 3, 4 and 5 there as numerous examples where men wearing bronze armour are speared through the torso, including examples of breastplates getting punched through and bellies being cut open. Now take a look at the above image. Imagine how heavy that must have been to wear. But to what avail? Literally the only thing that gear ever does is to loudly announce the death of it's wearer as Homer often describes \\""His armour clanged around him as he fell\\"". The spears doing all this are only made of the same thing the armour is. Use a jackhammer or a gun and I might accept it getting pierced. But what I'm reading in the Iliad makes no sense to me.

So what happens after? Where does the wine go after?

But what I don't like about the majority of the more known plays is that they're tragedies, and definitely don't have much of a happy ending. And I like the sad endings on occasion, but they're really bumming me out right now lol. 

So, are there any greek (or other historic) plays that have happy-is endings? I'm thinking comedies and saytrs *could* fall under this, but I'm not sure (Lysistrata seems to be ok). And I'm tired of reasing about the main character blinding themselves or being cursed!

1641071870,"Drawing Comparisons: Antipater, Regent of the Argeads. The Macedonian Tywin Lannister","Was thinking about it earlier today how Antipater was such a savy player of geopolitics, especially in the years soon after Alexander's death. Ive found him to be a truly under-apprecaited figure in history considering the shrewdness of some of his decisions. These bare a marked similarity (at least in my opinion) to another ""power behind the throne"" type, only this one is a fictitious patriarch in a fantasy series..a little known bit of contemporary culture called game of thrones. The character is the head of House Lannister; Tywin son of Tytos. 

 I was wondering if these two figures could be used as a charcater study of one another, kinda like mirrors of each other especially since I'm working on a dissertation regarding the Hellenistic Period. Some things I noticed:

1) Competerence: Antipater kept Alexander's eastern push going, feeding the army with reinforcements while putting down rebellions among the Spartans and Thracians, much like Tywin did in his early years during the Tarbeck rebellions and his tenure as hand of the king.

2) Political maneuvering: After Alexander died Antipater managed to mostly corner the marriage market of the nobility, securing several important alliances to ensure his position and that of his family - something Tywin also tries to do with his own kids, except Jaime and Cersei have different plans...namely with each other.

3) Daddy issues: They both reject and effectively disinherit their most capable sons (Cassander for Antipater, Tyrion for Tywin) forcing them to make their own way in the world. 

4) Rocky relationships with their Royal Masters: Antipater and Queen Olympias began well enough, even joining forces to make sure Alexander assumed the crown after his father's death, but after competing for influence in Macedon after Alexander went off to conquer the world, they became mortal enemies. Aerys and Tywin also began on a good footing, but as the king went mad he started to get jealous of Tywin. Things went downhill from there.

5) Turbulent begginings / Identity as Reformers: Macedonia was a powder keg of instability before Philip, Antipater, and a slew of other Old guard generals turned it into a functional state. Before them civil wars during periods of succession had been common, as was political assassination. Likewise  House Lannister had become a laughing stock by the time Tywin arrived on the scene; with unruly lords and lands infested with brigandry and crime. His iron fist turned it into one of the most feared and powerful houses in the seven kingdoms, and before that he had fought in the war of the nine penny kings at a relatively young age.

The list was surprising when I thought about it and Antipater is a fascinating figure I wish we knew more about. I am curious to know what you guys think, and if you have anything to add.",ancientgreece

I don't know who wrote it, and I don't remember the exact quote, but it went a little something like this:

...a dolphin, plunging like a phallus into the sea...

I haven't been able to find a trace of anything even remotely similar.  Does anybody out there know if there really is a poem or fragment like that in ancient Greek poetry?  If so, who wrote it and where can I find it?  Thanks in advance.",ancientgreece

[42: Thrace, Crossroads of Campaigns](https://castingthroughancientgreece.com/42-thrace-crossroads-of-campaigns/)

The Thracians would become famous for their fighting abilities in foreign armies as mercenaries, often fulfilling the role of skirmishes, excelling at hit and run tactics. Though, in the 6th and early 5th centuries we receive very little detail of their battles. We do hear that they were able to defeat Greek colonists and inflict heavy losses on the Persians during a period that their lands would become a crossroads of campaigning for the Persian empire with their attempts to expand north to Scythia and west towards Macedon and Greece.

1638153906,Lysistrata is the ultimate No-Nut November play.,"I‚Äôm being facetious, of course, but what better time of year than now to read (or re-read) Aristophanes‚Äô ‚ÄúLysistrata‚Äù? 

This is a really interesting one to me for several reasons. I‚Äôm relatively a novice to Ancient Greek literature and have only recently begun to tackle some of it because of how intimidating it can seem. 

For one, the Lysistrata is obviously extremely dirty, but beyond that, it‚Äôs one of the only works of Ancient Greek literature I‚Äôve read that holds up extremely well for today‚Äôs audiences without having to know much about the culture, political system, religions, social mores, etc. When I read Homer I often feel like I‚Äôm reading about an alien planet, the customs are so odd. That‚Äôs enjoyable and informative in a different way, but in my opinion, with the Lysistrata, you can really just jump right in as a novice and (with a few exceptions), the jokes will make plenty of sense even without footnotes. 

29 of the 40 plays Aristophanes wrote are lost to time, which bums me out, but the 11 we do have are fascinating. I‚Äôm looking forward to reading more of them.  

Does anyone else feel that way about this particular play? And/or do you have suggestions for other good short works that might be easier for beginners to access?",ancientgreece

1638068790,Any Art History buffs who can help a college kid out?,"Hey! 

Writing an essay arguing that some rulers/politicians in Ancient Greece and Rome depicted themselves with references to mythology, as the associated myth (or god) conveyed a value which they wished to be associated with b/c it would benefit them politically. It's for a Classical Art class. 

I have two examples so far:  

1. A [tetradrachm](https://www.slam.org/collection/objects/36557/) depicting Alexander the Great wearing the pelt of the Nymean lion which Heracles traditionally wore. Mostly arguing the association is twofold: Promoting the idea of overwhelming excellence in achievement, as Heracles successfully completed his tasks; AND that Heracles had the rare honor of being deified after death, so Alexander may share this fate because he's so great.
2. The [Augustus of Primaporta](https://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/collezioni/musei/braccio-nuovo/Augusto-di-Prima-Porta.html), which has the following gods/goddesses depicted on the chest piece: Sol (sun) and caelus (sky), tellus (earth goddess), Apollo, Aurora and Diana. I'm arguing that this was done to emphasize the fact that Augustus possessed a connection to the gods, a connection to the past, and martial prowess -- thereby, he was an emperor worthy of respect.

I really need a third example, but can't think of one. Do you guys know of anything that might resemble these two -- a political figure adopting mythology to communicate a message? Dying, because I have to present the outline of my paper this coming Monday.",ancientgreece

1638044796,The damaging effect of 300 (movie) on the view of Sparta,"For much I have noticed the effects of the movie 300 on the view of Sparta and how people react to it, the movie has several elements and topics around messages of courage and fight for freedom while showing heavy anti-eastern sentiments and downplaying the achievement of several other greeks states present at the battle, the effects are more than prominent such as the state used as symbolism for fascism supports or American gun owners and individuals of the such.  
Damn I think this greatly damaged and oversimplified the city-state view very badly, meanwhile its glorification is inoffensive it also became associated with nazi scum and such, I noticed how many people constantly is more concerned about demonizing Spartans as baby eaters, rapists, and nazis rather than actually learn more about it, comparisons to other city-states of the time and how it really operated, as someone who loves the greek state this saddens me very much and I feel like people try to say to me that what I like is wrong.",ancientgreece

1637430091,About the ritual of Bugonia,"**Bugonia**  was a ritual based on the belief that bees were spontaneously generated  from a cow's carcass, that was killed in order to create new life in  the form of bees :

&gt;Build  a house, ten cubits high, with all the sides of equal dimensions,  with  one door, and four windows, one on each side; put an ox into it,   thirty months old, very fat and fleshy; let a number of young men kill   him by beating him violently with clubs, so as to mangle both flesh and   bones, but taking care not to shed any blood; let all the orifices,   mouth, eyes, nose etc. be stopped up with clean and fine linen,   impregnated with pitch; let a quantity of thyme be strewed under the   reclining animal, and then let windows and doors be closed and covered   with a thick coating of clay, to prevent the access of air or wind.   After three weeks have passed, let the house be opened, and let light   and fresh air get access to it, except from the side from which the wind   blows strongest. Eleven days afterwards, you will find the house full   of bees, hanging together in clusters, and nothing left of the ox but   horns, bones and hair.

*From the Byzantine ""Geoponika"".*

I have a few questions :

1. Why  those two animals specifically, a large ruminant giving birth to small  insects ? Are they ""naturally"" linked to each other, or do the ritual  artificially forces the cow to produce bees ?
2. Did the ancient Greeks believed in other combinations straying from the ""Ox to bees"" original ritual, with other species of animals ?
3. Is there any additional sources on the subject ?

I have a VERY hard time believing this, and I wonder where exactly this came about and why so many people seem to think he was just a lucky general? The only thing lucky about him is how he managed to not die despite being in the front lines constantly, and how an arrow shot him in the chest and could have killed him but he also survived. Yes, Persia was an insanely powerful foe, but I don't think you can so easily dismiss his commanding abilities either. He was able to inspire and motivate his troops with epic speeches, we know of one such epic speech after a conspiracy to mutiny. He was an able fighter himself, constantly in the heat of danger and on the front lines. Among much more.

1636336517,Help with interesting quote from Diodorus,"I was reading Diodorus work and his historical account of the Diadochi and one passage stuck out at me and it was this one: 

‚ÄúIn Asia, after the defeat of Demetrius at Gaza in Syria, Seleucus received from Ptolemy not more than 800 infantry and about 200 cavalry, and set out for Babylon. So high were his expectations that even without any military force at all but accompanied only by his friends and his own slaves he would have undertaken the march into the interior. He reckoned that the Babylonians would readily join his side because of the goodwill they already felt towards him, while Antigonus, by withdrawing his forces a long distance away, had provided him with a suitable opportunity to realise his own ambitions. While he himself was full of eagerness, the friends around him could see that the troops with them were very few in number but that their opponents had large forces available, abundant supplies and a mass of allies, and they were very discouraged. When Seleucus saw their alarm he encouraged them, reminding them that those who had campaigned with Alexander and who had been promoted by him because of their valour should not, when facing adversity, put their trust solely in armed forces and money but in experience and skill, the means by which Alexander himself had achieved his great and universally admired deeds. They should also trust the forecast of the gods, that the end of the expedition would be worthy of his purpose: for when he had consulted the oracle at Branchidae the god had addressed him as King Seleucus, and Alexander himself appearing to him in a dream had given him a clear sign of good and admired among men is achieved by exertion and taking risks. He also courted the favour of his fellow soldiers and dealt with all of them as an equal, which made everyone respect him and be ready to face willingly the perils of the bold venture.‚Äù - Diodorus, XIX.90 

I‚Äôm new to studying the Ancient Greek world and it‚Äôs history and especially the Hellenistic World or Hellenistic Period that followed after the death of Alexander the Great. I know Seleucus was one of Alexander the Greats generals and I was wondering what is the exact content, context and significance of this historical source? Thanks!",ancientgreece

1635848557,Halloween Mirrors Spooky Beliefs of the Ancient Greeks," Could Halloween, the annual celebration observed in numerous countries across the world on October 31, have ancient Greek roots?

Halloween activities, such as donning spooky costumes, trick or treating, attending costume parties, carving pumpkins, watching scary movies, and visiting pumpkin patches and haunted sites, make the holiday extremely popular amongst the young and the old.

### Halloween likely has roots in Celtic pagan festivals

Yet the celebration is not as secular as it may seem. Also known as All Hallow‚Äôs Eve, Halloween has a religious connection. It takes place on the day before the western Christian feast of All Saints‚Äô Day, or All Hallows‚Äô Day. For believers, it is a time to honor and remember the dead, particularly saints and martyrs.

 The many traditions associated with Halloween, however, link it to pagan practices. Most scholars agree that the roots of Halloween and related traditions can be found in pagan Celtic harvest festivals, particularly Samhain.

Likely, these long-held, important traditions and festivals remained even after the Celts were Christianized, and were connected to Christian celebrations.

Much of the Halloween celebrations and traditions that are practiced today were made popular after immigrants from Ireland and Scotland brought them to North America in the 19th century.

Although Halloween itself is linked to Celtic practices, the spooky holiday has many parallels to ancient Greek beliefs as well.

### Ancient Greeks loved spooky tales, like those told on Halloween

  [Debbie Felton](https://www.umass.edu/classics/member/debbie-felton), Professor of Classics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has revealed that ‚Äúlong before Halloween became popular, [ancient Greeks ](https://greekreporter.com/tag/ancient-greeks/)and Romans enjoyed spinning good scary stories about the afterlife, as well as ghosts and monsters.‚Äù

In her novel study, entitled ‚ÄúHaunted [Greece](https://greekreporter.com/greece/) and Rome: Ghost Stories from Classical Antiquity,‚Äù Felton examined various interesting stories of ghostly spirits and haunting from ancient times, shedding new light on the modern folkloric traditions on the supernatural and[ the monstrous](https://greekreporter.com/2021/09/18/ancient-greek-origins-werewolves/).

‚ÄúThere are many reasons why people enjoy them and enjoy being scared by them. There‚Äôs certainly a cathartic effect to hearing a ghost story and being scared out of your wits without ever being in any real danger,‚Äù Professor Felton has shared.

Remaining dead serious¬†about the deep connection of Halloween ghosts and monsters with Classical Antiquity‚Äôs terrifying narrations, Felton added: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ ghost stories ultimately reflect religious beliefs concerning the importance [of a proper burial](https://greekreporter.com/2021/08/27/greek-funeral-customs-from-ancient-times-to-today/) and the survival of the spirit after death. The dead have a need to rest in peace, while the living have a need to believe in an afterlife‚Ä¶‚Äù

 The professor is an editor of the interdisciplinary academic journal [‚ÄúPreternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural,‚Äù ](https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/preternature/)which is¬†published by¬†[Penn State University Press](http://www.psupress.org/).

According to Felton, monsters and serial killers, either real or fictional, ‚Äúhave been with us since earliest antiquity,‚Äù being¬†often ‚Äúeven more horrifying than their modern counterparts,‚Äù while she is skeptical about the existence of¬†ghosts.",ancientgreece

I thought solo-ing the Acropolis and it's museum at my pace would do that, but it has left me feeling disappointed. Mostly because I am not learning or feel like I am engaged with the history in front of me as I would like to. I would occasionally hear guides for other groups and thought that that was exactly what would help,  


I am here for 2 more days, do you think going back to the acropolis with a guide would be worthwhile, or should I cut my losses and do a guide for a different activity. (I also like nature if you think I should just double down and connect with my inner self / natural world of Greece)

1635264984,A Griffin Warrior: A Staggering Discovery from Ancient Greece," 

The discovery of the Griffin Warrior Tomb is one of the most fascinating archaeological findings as it seems to link the Minoan and the Mycenaean civilisations.

On May 28, 2015, the archaeologists excavating in Pylos, southwestern Greece, discovered a Bronze Age tomb with a skeleton surrounded by rich artefacts, suggesting it belonged to an important man.

The grave belongs to the Mycenaean Civilisation, approximately 1750 BC-1050 BC. Also, many of the objects found seem to be related to the Minoan Civilisation, c. 3500 BC ‚Äì 1100 BC.

 

Overall archaeological research has shown that the Mycenaean had reached most of the eastern Mediterranean, including ancient Egypt, the city-states of the Near East (today‚Äôs Turkey), and the islands of the Mediterranean.

However, the strongest connection discovered is the one with the Minoan Civilisation in the island of Crete.

The Minoan Civilisation was named after the legendary King Minos, but the islanders‚Äô culture was very different from that found on mainland Greece.",ancientgreece

1634276145,"Byzantines: Greeks, Romans, or Greeks cosplaying as Romans?","So this is a controversial topic, especially among Roman history enthusiasts (less among Roman history *scholars*), but I want the opinions of some of you Hellenophiles. Obviously this goes beyond the ~400CE (which is a strange date for setting the end of the Ancient era IMO) time frame, so apologies for that. 

Anyway, I am of the opinion the ""Romans"" beyond their Crisis of the Third Century began to become less and less ""Roman"" and more and more Greek over the next few centuries. It wasn't just some ""Rome ended in 224CE"" or anything so simple as that, but the Romans were 97% Roman when Septimius Severus took control, were 80% Roman by Diocletian (and like 18% Greek), and these numbers just swapped over the coming centuries. Justinian and Belisarius are often considered the ""last"" Romans, and I think this is probably a pretty good point to consider the Eastern Roman Empire becoming majority Greek. Of language, culture, architecture, religion, foodstuffs, naming, pretty much all of it. By the death of Justinian they were say 52% Greek and 35% Roman and the rest mixed Germanic, Syriac, maybe tiny bits Celtic, etc etc. 

Obviously they are almost nothing like the Archaic or Classical Hellenes. We can call them Hellenes 4.0 (Mycenaeans being 1.0, Archaic/Classical 2.0, Hellenistic in Egypt, Bactria, India, Syria, along the Euxine being 3.0). But they seem as distinct from the Romans of Camillus, Africanus, Caesar or Trajan as the Greeks were. This is why we call them the Byzantines, not simply for the ease of distinguishing them from the WRE or the Holy Roman Empire or Rum. 

I believe we should come up with a new term for these people, to highlight the fact they were mostly Greeks, or peoples that had mixed with some Greeks, or Hellenized to some degree. Helleno-Roman perhaps. Every time I have brought this up among Roman-enthusiast, the Roman fanboys basically just insult me to the point of drowning out any discussion, because they **so want** the Romans to continue to 1453. This seems much too simplistic to me. 

Anyway, I would be very interested in hearing some Hellenophiles thoughts on the Byzantines, how ""Roman"" they were, if others view them similarly to myself as primarily Greek, but heavily influenced by Italian...well everything.",ancientgreece

The Helots of Sparta were by all accounts treated miserably by the Spartans who are considered or believed be a group of Indo Europeans who migrated to the Greece mainland.

The treatment of Helots sound an awful like how Indo-Europeans in India treated thier subjugated people. In fact it even sounds like a caste system. Assigning them to lower castes and just generally treating them miserably. We often hear about how the Indo Europeans were a small group of invader who ruled larger local populations. Well this sounds exactly like that.

So were the Helots people in a similar situation?

I've heard Helots being described as everything from a slaves from foreign lands to neighbouring city states conquered by the Spartans. But none of the explanations make sense. But the subjugation of people and forcing them into the lower castes of society makes more sense. I mean Doric Spartans were believed to be Indo European and these people set up similar systems in India. So it wouldn't be a stretch to thing that Helots were simply pre Indo Europeans who were under foreign rule. 


It even explains the Peloponnesian war and the lack of political unity of Greece in classical era. The Achaeian Delian league being places with more pre Indo European cultures or people while the Spartans led Peloponnesian League being more Indo European. It would explain why so historical writers said that they could tell Dorics and Achaeian apart.

Who minted it?,"I have been looking at Cumae, which is assumed to be one of the first sites of Greek colonization (I'm counting Pithekussai as a trading post), but this coin confuses me. You see, my understanding is that Cumae was taken from the Greeks by Oscans and Samnites in 421 BCE, but did not fall under Roman rule until 338 BCE. 

So, what was going on when this coin was minted? Who minted it? I'm still learning about Greek history, but it seems that--since this is a didrachm--it must be a Greek coin.

Sorry if this is an obvious answer, but I've searched online and can't find any info on what Cumae was like in this period.

1632437187,Cyrus the Moses,"Xenophon Cyropedia 1.2.2
&gt;*Cyrus* was educated in conformity with the laws of the Persians; and these laws appear in their care for the common weal not to start from the same point as they do in most states. For most states permit every one to train his own children just as he will, and the older people themselves to live as they please; and then they command them **not to steal and not to rob**, not to break into anybody's house, not to strike a person whom they have no right to strike, **not to commit adultery**, not to disobey an officer, and so forth; and if a man transgress anyone one of these laws, they punish him.
 
Xenophon, Cyropaedia 1.3 *Child prodigy aged 12*
&gt; Cyrus received until he was *twelve years old* or a little more; and he showed himself superior to all the other boys of his age both in mastering his tasks quickly and in doing everything in a thorough and manly fashion  

&gt; Luke 2:42 when he was twelve years

In the Cyropedia, King Cyrus was a child prodigy and educated in Laws that includes **not to steal, not to commit adultery** and it describes breaking them as a **transgression**

The verb transgress in Xenophon is **œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤Œ±ŒØŒΩœâ** and the Hebrew translation is **◊î◊¢◊ë◊ô◊®**

&gt;Deuteronomy 26:13
◊ú◊ê ◊¢◊ë◊®◊™◊ô ◊û◊û◊¶◊ï◊™◊ô◊ö 

&gt;Œø·Ωê œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤Œ≠Œ≤Œ∑Œ∫Œ± œÑŒ¨ Œ∏Œ≠œÉŒºŒπŒ± œÉŒøœÖ ""I have not transgressed thy laws""

The verb ◊¢◊ë◊®◊™◊ô could also be ·ºÅŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒ¨ŒΩœâ.  So the language here in the Torah and Xenophon are very much the same.

Numbers 8:7 ◊ú◊ó◊ò◊ê◊™ / œÑ·øá Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ¨œÅœÉŒµŒπ
  ""for cleansing from guilt""

&gt;&gt; Homer's Odyssey 3.446
Then the old man, Nestor, driver of chariots, began the opening rite of hand-washing and sprinkling with barley grains, and earnestly he prayed to Athena, cutting off as first offering the hair from the head, and casting it into the fire.


&gt;&gt;Electra 90
I wept and cut off a lock of my hair as an offering and sacrificed over the altar the blood of a slaughtered sheep

&gt;&gt; Numbers 6:18 ‚Äî The Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.

So the rituals of the Torah are not unique to Jews, this also includes Matsza, barley cake eaten by Spartans hence eaten as a reminder of slavery.

&gt;&gt;Aeschylus Agamemnon 1035
Once endured to be sold and to eat the bread of slavery **(ŒºŒ¨Œ∂Œ∑œÇ)**

1642448660,Pompey finishing his duty on iberia,"As sertorius effectively used guerrilla tactics, he constantly kept pompeys and Pius armies separated. Finally, he made so that both generals couldn‚Äôt resupply themselves in sertorius region, so they fell back to the region the senate commanded. As pompey invested a lot of his own money in the campaign, he asked money from the senate and said he would enter Italy with his army if they didn‚Äôt send it. Lucullus, who was a consul and was at variance with pompey, intending to get the command of the Mithridatic war, sent his own money fearing pompey would leave sertorius and attack Mithridates, as it would be a honor to oppose him and an easy affair to resolve. Sertorius got himself assassinated by his friends, one of his best general, perpenna, being the chief of the deed. He tried to do the same as sertorius did, but he didn‚Äôt have the intelligence for it

Pompey attacked perpenna asap and as he saw him ill managing his troops, he sent 10 cohorts to a open plain as bait, having ordered them to pretend to flee thereafter. Perpenna pursuit them and pompey appeared with a full force, winning a decisive victory. Most of the officers fell, but perpenna was brought to pompey and pompey ordered his death, differently from what he had done in sicily, using sound judgement instead, especially because perpenna said he could produce letters from a lot of powerful men of Italy who asked sertorius to invade their country so the status quo could be changed. This made pompey fear a war bigger than this one he just had finished, even so he burned the letters without reading it

Perpenna death didn‚Äôt exactly end the war, there were still some towns, especially those in the eastern cost, the region of the arevaci. Pompey burned a town and left the rest of the work, which was little, to another one, leaving for italy",ancientrome

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for resources regarding Roman dwelling around the time of Augustus to around 100'ish AD. 

Essentially I'm looking to research Roman dwellings to see how they're structured and what sort of amenities were available in various rungs of society (from the poorest to the wealthiest). I'm curious because reading through the Philippian Jailer and his baptism, I was reminded of how plumbing wasn't readily available so I was curious how, if the doctrine of immersion is correct, how Paul was able to baptize the whole family using immersion if most Roman dwellings didn't have amenities such as indoor plumbing for water.",ancientrome

1642438609,Pompey begining his Iberian campaign,"Philippus when proposed pompey as proconsul, he publicly said that both consuls were the same as nothing. Pompey going to Iberia got the Iberians hopes high again, so the cities that weren‚Äôt firmly attached to sertorius, started moving towards pompey. Sertorius tried to trash talk pompey, saying he just didn‚Äôt checked him cuz of Pius. But regarding his military decisions, sertorius were even more cautious now, fearing pompey, always watching him. Unexpectedly, Pius started to relax and not to care about his service as he should. Pompey tried to compensate this by living a harsh life, which increased even further his reputation. Though there were many vicissitudes in the war, sertorius burning a city after capturing it was what shocked pompey the most, the fact that he thought sertorius was surrounded until he realized he himself was hemmed in, probably added to his shock. He recovered when soon after he slaughter 10000 men from two talented generals under sertorius. Elated by this success, he started to design great plans and rushed to check sertorius, so Pius couldn‚Äôt receive honors for it. They clashed on the bank of a river, when the days was closing. Both sides wanted to finish the fight asap. Both sides won a wing, but sertorius got the better advantage, for he put to flight those who opposed him. An infantry of tall stature attacked pompey who was on horseback. Their struggle came to close quarters, and both got swords injuries on their hands, pompey being only injured, and the infantry getting his hand cut off. As a lot of people tried to catch pompey, and the rout had already begun, he himself fled, contrary to expectation, getting down his horse and leaving it behind with great wealth on it as ornaments. Sertorius men preferred to fight among themselves for the booty than to chase him

At daybreak, both generals got their forces in order of battle so to secure a victory, but when Pius approached, sertorius retreated and his army dispersed, as it was his modus operandi, frequently wandering alone and suddenly gathering 150k men. Pompey and Pius met, pompey ordering his lictors to lower down their fasces as a show of respect towards pius, meaning he was superior in rank. But Pius didn‚Äôt want to hear nothing of it and kept treating pompey as an equal, not like he was a consul or the elder; except when both armies encamped together, it was Pius who gave the watchword, but generally both armies encamped apart",ancientrome

1642405776,Pompey alliance with the optimates after sullas death,"Sulla was afraid of pompeys fame, but he did nothing for fear of the people‚Äôs response. Sulla didn‚Äôt mentioned pompey in his testament; pompey stayed quiet on the matter and when lepidus was sabotaging sullas funeral at the field of mars, making it less great than it was expected and also impeding it to be public, pompey got soldiers on it so the funeral was a great one and with public attendance. Lepidus was aggressively trying to take sullas place, using the remnants of the factions that were suppressed by sulla. Catulus was the first of the romans at the time, but was thought he was better in civil affairs. The Senate then turned to pompey, and he allying himself with the optimiates, was given command of an army to counter lepidus, who already had stirred up a great part of Italy and was holding up in the Alps with Brutus father as his commander. Pompey easily defeated everything except this alpine base. While he besieged Brutus at the city of mutina, lepidus hurried to Rome to threat everybody with a huge army so he could be appointed consul. But either Brutus surrendered or his army changed sides. He was given free pass with cavalry escorting him so he could rest in a small town. But one day later, pompey sent a person to kill him. The romans didn‚Äôt like this though. But pompey tried to hid the case, as he first sending a letter to the Senate that brutus peacefully surrendered, but then sending a second saying he betrayed them. Lepidus seeing his case weaker, escaped to sardinia and killed himself, probably because he found out his wife committed adultery

But the Senate couldn‚Äôt rest yet, for sertorius who commanded Iberia and were better than lepidus was opposing them. Sertorius had gathered all factions opposing the optimiates and already had defeated a lot of generals but now was contending with mettelus Pius who was a nice general. But Pius, a old man, accustomed with the standard way the romans fought, heavy infantry engaging in close quarters. But sertorius used guerrilla tactics so he was winning this contend. Pompey stationed his army on a city next to Pius, intending to help him, but catulus ordered pompey to put down his army but pompey denied it, giving innumerous excuses until Lucius phillipus gave him the command through a proposal",ancientrome

1642220029,Pompeys lybian campaign,"Pompey was stricter regarding the most notorious enemies of sulla, but he was lenient towards everybody else. He helped a lot of persons to evade prosecutions. Pompey intended to ill treat an entire city who sided with the enemy. An inhabitant told pompey that himself was to blame as he persuaded his friends to ally with him and forced his enemies to fight him. Pompey like the bold discourse and first acquitted this person and then all the city. Hearing that his soldiers were committing atrocities, he put a seal to their swords and whoever broke it would be put to death 

While he was managing the civil administration of sicily, he received orders to go to lybia to put the rebels down, which were a huge force. Pompey left sicily to his sister‚Äôs husband, memmius and set sail with 120 war ships and 800 transports which conveyed money, corn, engines and missiles. When he ported at Utica and Carthage, 7k enemies soldiers changed to his side, making his numbers to 6 legions. Some pompeian soldiers got their hands on a huge treasure; this news reached the rest, and everybody thought it was a treasure hid from the fall of carthage. Pompey couldn‚Äôt do nothing with them for several days, as they were treasure hunting. Pompey kept walking nearby the hunters making jest of them. Not long after his soldiers desisted and begged pompey to conduct them towards the campaign

The enemy leader, domitius, put himself opposed to pompey with a rough ravine in his front. In the morning started a long period of wild rain and wind making domitius to abandon his intention to give battle, so that he retreated. Pompey took the advantage and started rapidily crossing the ravine; domitius forces went bananas and so couldn‚Äôt mount a nice resistance, while the storm blew in their faces. The storm also affected the pompeians, pompey himself took too long to respond to a call check from one of his soldiers and almost got friendly fired. Having repulsed the enemy with great slaughter (out of 20k, only 3k fled), pompeys soldiers saluted him as imperator, but he denied the honor asking them to finish the job first. They attacked domitius ramparts camp, pompey fought without helmet fearing another friendly fire. The camp was taken, and domitius killed. Some nearby cities surrendered to pompey, others had to be stormed. Pompey took one of the kings that sided with domitius as hostage, put another in his place",ancientrome

1642184841,Pompeys actions during sullas struggle for hegemony,"Pompey was surrounded by three armies, one of them being led by Brutus father. Pompey didn‚Äôt get alarmed and decided to full attack Brutus army, putting his cavalry in his frontline, among them he himself was present. One of the others army tried to help Brutus, but pompey aggressively repealed it, killing its commander with a spear. The two remaining commanders fought among themselves and their armies started falling back as the best they could. The nearby cities started flocking to pompey. Next it was scipio the consul who was sent to deal with pompey, but before both lines were close enough for javelins, scipios soldiers started saluting pompey and then flocked to him, making scipio to flee. Finally, near a river, carbo himself attacked pompey with a large force of cavalry. Pompey bravely stood his ground and repealed them, making them retreat. Pompey chased them, making them moving to a bad ground for cavalry, making his enemies to surrender. When sulla heard that pompey was so in danger, he sent a force to relieve him. When pompey heard sulla was inbound, he ordered his men to display themselves as the most gallant way possible in way to receive an award from their imperator. Pompey got more honors than he expected, because when sulla saw this display, he got down of his horse and being addressed by imperator did the same when addressed pompey. Sulla kept showing an ultimate respect to pompey, more than to anybody else

Pompey was sent to gaul to strip metellus of his power, as he wasn‚Äôt meeting what was expected and of him, but pompey said he wouldn‚Äôt strip power from a man senior and superior to him regarding reputation. But he said he was willing to help metellus to keep conducting the war as his subordinate. Metellus accepted the help and pompey perfomed great deeds and helped fueling metellus spirit again

When sulla got the mastery of rome, he started honoring his officers with riches and magistracies, but he thought pompey superior to all, so he offered his stepdaughter, who was pregnant and married. Pompey accepted, put his own wife aside, probably because he was afraid of sulla. Then came news that sicily and lybia was becoming a base of operations of the remainder of the opposing faction, with a powerful navy on sicily and powerful army at lybia. Pompey was sent to sicily to put them down. Sicilian army evade battle fleeing beforehand. He treated their cities with kindness except one who spoke against roman system of justice. Pompey treated carbo not with so much kindness though. Plutarch claims that if carbo should be indeed put to death, he shouldve on the moment of the capture as the blame would fall on the one who ordered it. But pompey put a man in chains who had three times being consul; during the trial he left him standing while himself was judging while he was sitting down, annoying everyone present",ancientrome

1642180557,Pompeys life till the beginning of carbo-sulla struggle,"The romans adored pompey. They thought he led a temperate life, that he was a fine warrior, a good orator, a pious person and easy proned to help others without seconds interests. His face was also reason for their affability: his expression had dignity and kindness; he had a longer hair and soft eyes. Pompey consorted with a lot of married woman, using his power to help him through. In his youth, he served under his father when the latter opposed cinna. During campaign, a companion of pompey was bribed by cinna to kill pompey and to burn his father tent. When pompey found out about it through a third, he didnt care and kept happily drinking with his companion. When time to sleep came about, he sent guards to his father and patiently waited. His companion struck his bed with a sword and fired up a mutiny that was being brewed. When the mutiny was aggressively moving to his fathers tent, he opposed them crying out loud and giving himself as sacrifice, making them desist of the mutiny except 800 men. When his father died, he defended him against the accusation of corruption. Pompey was initially found guilty of having stole items from a illegal plunder of his father. Pompey nicely defended his case and a praetor, who was also presiding the judging process was so impressed with him that he offered his daughter as spouse to him and he accepted. The president acquitted him

As cinna tyranny gave way to a worse one, sulla fought this worse tyrant, and the romans were happy about sullas fight. Pompey was at picenium because he liked the region and its cities, mainly because the cities liked him because of his father. Pompey saw everybody around him fleeing to sullas camp in search for protection. He thought that he should instead serve sulla with his money and a armed force. Pompey easily raised a lot of soldiers at picenium and carbo couldnt raise not a single one from there. Its said that a person told the people that pompey just quitted school and started leading them, making this people to kill the mocker. Pompey with 23 years old took command of a large citys army without being appointed. He placed a tribunal in the forum and banished two persons who were the chiefs city and were opposing pompey on behalf of carbo. Pompey then started appointing centurions and officers and repeated the process on the nearby cities. He got three legions by this method and having supplied his army with a lot of waggons etc slowly moved towards sulla as he wanted to strip every possible italys region from carbo",ancientrome

1642177377,When and why did the Roman people/people of the Italian peninsula transition out of military roles?,"Sorry if this is a vague question.

I can‚Äôt help but noticing in the latter days of the Empire that a sizable number of western Roman commanders, if not the vast majority were not of traditionally Roman heritage. Many seemed to come from outer provinces and had heritage of conquered peoples.

Couple this with Italy‚Äôs fairly constant conquest by outside entities, whether they be Germanic tribes like the Lombards or Ostrogoths, or other entities like the Holy Roman Empire, the Carolingian Empire, the Normans, different French and Spanish Kingdoms, or Arabic Caliphates. 

It seems at some point the Roman/Italian peoples had lost a military culture that existed in earlier days. In turn this lead to Italy being a ripe target for conquest and domination.

1642012214,Brutus life till the battle of pharsalus,"Brutus descended to a person who had a statue of himself in the capitol in the midst of the kings with a sword drawn, representing him as the one who put them down. Brutus was know for his virtue  discipline, philosophical spirit and earnest and mild character; even so that, regarding caesars assassination, even his enemies attributed its benefits to him and its harm to cassius. Even his mother descended from a person who fought tyranny. Brutus mother was sister of cato, the philosopher, whom he used as model to himself; cato being also his father in law. Brutus also used a lot the greek philosophers as model; platos school being his predilection. Brutus latin oratory was advanced, but his greek not so much, as he used the laconian brevity. Brutus, in his youth, accompanied cato to cyprus; the latter, being sent from the senate, to manage the region. Cato needed brutus to perform a difficult administrative task, and brutus performed well, earning his uncle trust. Brutus took a lot of wealth from cyprus as reward and sailed back to rome

When he was 36 and caesars civil war came about, brutus was expected to join caesar, as they were friends and especially as pompey had put his father to death. But probably he thought pompey claim more reasonable and so joined him; but yet, he would not talk to pompey. Brutus, as a legate, went to sicily; but as there wasnt much to do there, and as pompey and caesar rushed to contend for the supremacy, he went as a volunteer to macedonia to take share in the danger. When pompey saw him, being surprised and delighted, rose from his seat, and embraced him as if he was superior to everybody in their presence. During the daylight at the campaign, when not close to pompey, he would be hard studying or reading books, including during preparation to great battles. It was in the height of summer, and as they were encamped close to a marshy ground, the heat was unbearable. The ones responsible for carrying brutus tent were late, and being harassed by it, it was already midday and he didnt, practically, anointed himself or ate, while the rest were happily resting, he kept writing till evening, when he finished an important epitome. Its said that caesar cared a lot about brutus. Caesar ordered his officers to not kill brutus in battle and if he yielded, to bring brutus to him, but on the contrary, to leave him alone; its said he did this to please brutus mother, whom he was in a relationship with. Caesar thought reasonable to think that brutus could be his son, as brutus birth mathematics was aligned",ancientrome

1641657397,Octavian response to caesars death,"When news of caesar death reached octavian, he was taking classes at apollonia, macedonia. One of its subjects were military doctrine with the 5 caesars legions drilling for a parthia campaign. Some of its officers, counsel him to stay with them for protection, but he refused, crossing to the region of brundisium in search for political gain. Learning caesars will content, that he was adopted by him and therefore, his primary heir (with 2/3 of his estate). He accepted caesars name, probably throwing away his own cuz it was more modest. Brundisium were a base of operations of eastern campaigns, octavian received a warm reception from caesars veterans there, probably given him courage to ‚Äústeal‚Äù a lot of senatorial money intended for caesars parthian campaign cuz he intended to climb roman political ladder faster. He started marching to rome, using the money to employ caesars veterans and parthia intended soldiers in his army. Reaching rome, he found mark antony rivaling with him on caesars faction hegemony. Octavian got optimates support, as they saw him as a lesser evil than antony, and easier to manipulate. Therefore, antony lost this battle, especially when two of his legion passed over to octavian, ‚Äúfleeing‚Äù to cisalpine gaul

The senate made octavian a senator and gave him veto and commanding power alongside the consuls, sending them with an army to resolve antony as a problem. On c. gaul, antony was besieging brutus brother. Octavian and one of the consuls were nearby, waiting for the other consul to arrive with reinforcements. Antony tried to fight before his forces was outnumbered, but the first consul denied it. Antony laid an ambush between the two armies. The second consul fell on it, but it was reinforced by the first one. In a narrow road, surrounded by marches, a bloody battle ensued. The consul was forced to retreat, but the first consul arrived and majorly defeated antony. Although octavian role was minimal, he was acclaimed imperator by his soldiers. Six days later, another battle took place, now on antonys camp. One of the consuls died inside it, octavian being in the thick of battle, got the eagle from an injured bearer and retrieved the consuls body. Antony lost again and decided to retreat to his reinforcements. The senate demanded that octavian handed over his command to brutus, as the two consuls were dead, but he refused. Brutus troops passed over to octavian, making him to flee

Octavian sent centurions as ambassadors to rome to demand the consulship. With its refuse, he marched on rome to no military opposition, being, therefore, elected consul alongside another caesar nephew. Antony allied himself with lepidus, a leading person of the caesarions. Later on, octavian joined them and they formed the famous 2nd triumvirate

I was impressed with the patience octavian demonstrated when antony denied his wealth, but him marching on rome was nuts. I understand he probably saw that the senate didnt truly respected him, but i dont think it was the best decision. I find the origins of the 2nd triumvirate strange. I see octavian on the higher ground then, why to ally with antony? Perhaps, he wasnt so higher. And indeed, the number brutus faction levied was insane",ancientrome

I'm sure he didn't anticipate people reading his personal letters for two milennia, but here we are.

So anyway, was this sort of cynicism/sarcasm about Rome typical for him? Obviously much of the city was pretty ramshackle at the time, but from what little I've read he seemed to take a lot of pride in the Republic and the city.",ancientrome

We don't really have any frightening villains like Shapur or Hannibal, no Alaric or Attila, no Zenobia or Mithridates. 

In this period we have the spiraling growth of Mithras followers, the rise of Sol Invictus, the auctioning off to Julianus, the devaluation of the silver in the denarius, the fall of the Parthians, etc...

1641273923,Gibbons on the vanity of Pescennius Niger,"As soon as the intelligence of the atrocious murder of Pertinax had reached Antioch, the wishes of Asia invited Niger to assume the Imperial purple and revenge his death. The legions of the eastern frontier embraced his cause; the opulent but unarmed provinces, from the frontiers of √Üthiopia to the Hadriatic, cheerfully submitted to his power; and the kings beyond the Tigris and the Euphrates congratulated his election, and offered him their homage and services. The mind of Niger was not capable of receiving this sudden tide of fortune: he flattered himself that his accession would be undisturbed by competition and unstained by civil blood; and whilst he enjoyed the vain pomp of triumph, he neglected to secure the means of victory. Instead of entering into an effectual negotiation with the powerful armies of the West, whose resolution might decide, or at least must balance, the mighty contest; instead of advancing without delay towards Rome and Italy, where his presence was impatiently expected, Niger trifled away in the luxury of Antioch those irretrievable moments which were diligently improved by the decisive activity of Severus.",ancientrome

1641035835,Soon to record episode on Hannibal at Trebia - any questions or aspects you want covered?,"Hi all,

As I am wont to mention it, I have a podcast (Ancient History Hound) and have covered a number of topic from ancient Rome (from the Baths through to a mini series on the Kings). I did an episode a few years ago on Hannibal's build up in Spain and how he developed there.

In 2022 I'm going to do a mini series on his battles of Trebia, Trasimene and Cannae. Depending on the interest I may also do more on his movements in southern Italy and perhaps Zama.

Anyway, I'm soon to record the episode I've written on Trebia. So far it looks at the build up (including a short overview of how Hasdrubal ended up in Spain), the characters involved, the units, what happened on the day and shortly after.

I'm always conscious of missing the obvious. So if anyone here has a question or aspect they'd like covered in relation to Trebia I'm all ears. I'll either do a question section at the end or ensure it's answered within the episode.

thanks!

I'm curious if telling a lie to them would in any way be seen as a transgression against the God's and therefore reason to fear some sort of divine wrath or at least bad luck.

1640754387,Germanic Barbarian Names,"So when reading late classical/early medieval Roman history I notice some Germanic names crop up that are still extant today. 

Two examples are 
* Roderick
* Frederick 

There are obviously names that have died out like Theoderic, Alaric, Athalaric, Theodohad etc. All the 'Suntha' suffix female names of the Goths seem to be long gone too, which is a shame because they're much prettier than the male names. 

I was wondering if the names Derrick and even Patrick have their origins in these Germanic names? I don't recall coming across a Derrick in this period (it would amused me enough I'd remember).

Second question, while lots of Punic/Jewish Biblical names have survived into the modern period, I suspect these are entirely revived rather than to be a continuum from ancient times. 

Is this the case with these Germanic names or has a name like Frederick really been in use for 1500 years?",ancientrome

1640734218,Sharing my research on the ethnicity of Marcus Aurelius,"Marcus Aurelius and his family came from the province of Hispania. Because I make depitctions of Roman emperors I really try my hardest to research what these men looked liked whether they be light or dark. 

I really want to say that I want to keep race out of this as much as possible and focus purely on genealogy and phenotypes. My motive for carrying out this research is to answer the question or at the very least come up with an educated guess based on some evidence on what ethnicity Marcus Aurelius was and whether he had Carthaginian or Celtic ancestry from where his family came from in the province of Hispania. His genealogy points to his family being from that region.

I believe Spain was very diverse at the time filled with people and families who never went back to Carthage after the Punic Wars and the descendants of the Iberians, Celtiberians, Tartessians, Lusitanians, and Vascones. All of which were Celtic and some of which would have had extremely light features. Marcus Aurelius and Commodus could have been a mix of several different ethnicities and of course had Italic ancestry.

I did some research and found these two reconstructed colorized busts of Marcus Aurelius, one of him as an [adult](https://external-preview.redd.it/1bJAOmSxeyLqHGbcTRuGlv0ybtKobblNakcPU8RlS6o.png?auto=webp&amp;s=8b5ea3cdea0d74ece16b21d5bc75da1dc896d043) and a [child](https://preview.redd.it/bv0kx6kw5o251.png?auto=webp&amp;s=cca80cf7dd31060dc5005ef219155101bf1e4926) which are based on the original pigment used. He appears to have brown curly hair and brown eyes. So he moderately dark features. That doesn't really say much as brown hair and brown eyes are extremely prevalent in the majority of humans regardless of ethnicity .

I proposed the idea that he might have had Carthagian or Tunisian ancestry but found it not likely and if he did it was probably very little. In comparison to the people of North Africa, Celtic people were very diverse in their appearance some having tribes having a propensity for white blonde hair and icy blue eyes, others sometimes having red hair and green/blue eyes and some even had extremely white skin with freckles which hugely contrasted their pitch black hair and a sort of golden brown eye color. I know this for a fact because my friends mother is Irish and she has pitch black hair, golden brown eyes, and extremely pale skin with freckles all over her face and body. 

I should also mention that curly hair is very common among some Celtic people. People with red hair are more likely to have wavy or curly hair. Celtic people are more likely to have red hair. You sometimes still see this in Ireland where some men and women have [red afros](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9745daca8d8fc18c375915bdb0cb89fe-lq) since Ireland has been more isolated from Greco/Roman, Frankish, and Anglo Saxon invaders in comparison to the former Celtic Kingdoms that existed throughout Europe. This means the Irish people still hold a very significant amount of genes from their Celtic ancestors since there was less ethnic diversity forced upon them by invasion, conquest and trade. Ireland has always maintained a very isolated attitude towards the rest of Europe and it's been that way even up until the 20th century which in some ways is responsible for all sorts of problems like terrorism throughout the United Kingdom in combination with religious differences and thousands of years of unresolved conflict. The Irish were historically less likely to let in outsiders therefore unlike the original Celtic inhabitants of Britannia there ethnicity remained pure and less diverse as the Celtic Britians were eradicated by interbreeding by conquering Romans and later Anglo Saxon, Norse people and Frankish tribes. 

So perhaps Marcus Aurelius and Commodus inherited their curly hair from a red headed Celtic ancestor and the brownish colored hair and eyes came from an a whole mix of Italic and Greek ancestors. Or it's possible they inherited their brown hair and eyes from a man or woman of Celtic descent? 

All I can say is there sure were a lot of diverse people in the ancient world. 

Usually when I look into the later emperors after the Flavian dynasty. I assume that emperors like Marcus Aurelius were not just one ethnicity or at least purely Italic, but instead I look at the modern world where in huge countries like American and Russia there are many different ethnicities living together and interbreeding. I see the Ancient Roman Empire which stretched from borders of Scottland to the edges of Parthia as no different. And even before the Roman Empire the Greeks had been colonizing and exploring west and northern Europe. As such the Celtic people living in the provinces of Transalpine Gaul, Hispania and Britannia almost certainly married into the aristocracy of  Patrician/Plebian men and their daughters who immigrated to those areas to become farmers as was the custom at the time, serve in the military as infantry police or participate in the many bureaucratic and governmental institutions that connected the provinces to the city of Rome to keep the Empire connected.

The stigma against Patrician-Plebian marriage for example had been declining since the 1st century BC and had started when Pompey the Great had won many victories and was the first Plebian to be awarded a military triumph. So it was becoming more acceptable to the point where in the 6th century a peasant became emperor and married a whore and he's now known as Justinian the Great.

The only reason I'm focusing on skin tone, hair color and eyes is because it's required for me to realistically portray these historical figures in my depictions. I want to get as close as possible to reality. I know that's impossible but I want to attempt to try. It's not a problem with facial features since you can clearly see and study them from their many busts and statues. For example Marcus Aurelius has a less prominent Aquiline nose than his son Commodus which might have been influenced by his mother.

Another interesting fact I found is that Marcus Aurelius and Commodus both have droopy eyes and curly hair which would imply both of those features are genetic. They obviously look very similar being father and son.

I found this research which suggests that droopy eyes can sometimes be a genetic trait of Northern Europeans and that leads me back to the Celtic connection.

&gt;The study, which was published in JAMA Dermatology, included two different groups in order to evaluate the extent to which droopy eyes are of a genetic cause. Of the first group of 5,578 unrelated participants with North European ancestry, 17.8 percent had moderate to severe sagging eyelids When researchers looked at the 2,186 twin participants, they found that within the pairs, 61 percent had inherited their sagging eyelids  
In addition to genetics, the study also found that age, being a male, having lighter skin color, and a higher body mass index (BMI) were all risk factors for sagging under-eye skin. A person with a higher BMI, typically has more fat accumulated than does a normal-weight person, which means their under-eye fat pads have a greater chance of being larger and protruding from the skin more.

Paul McCartney, Commodus and Marcus Aurelius [all have these droopy eyes.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/885043206243377193/925521093882708018/pmama.png) And the Celtic connection comes back again because Paul McCartney's family comes from Ireland.

&gt;It is unknown which part of Ireland Paul McCartney‚Äôs paternal side is from, but it is known that they first emigrated from Ireland to Galloway, Scotland, and then on to Liverpool.

Based on this research I find it likely that Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus had moderate to strong Celtic heritage from the locals living in Hispania. He definitely had Italic ancestry as well. Before some people accuse me of being a white supremist or whatever. This does not mean that his skin was particularly very white. Some Celtic people can in fact be darker in appearance and it might have been more common in certain tribes 2000 years ago. Some genealogists suggest that prehistoric Irish people had very dark skin, black hair and blue eyes. 

Sorry for the long post. I would add an tl;dr but this topic is a bit too complex for that. I don't expect everyone to read it, but if you do take the time to read it I thank you and would love to hear any opinions or criticism if you have any. Thank you.",ancientrome

For he, to begin with, in his early years he had openly prostituted his person, but later he showed great sharpness and an excellent memory, and while he was a terrible bully and most bold-faced in dealing with his inferiors he was most obsequious to his superiors. He was originally expelled from his native town as he was suspected of a design of betraying Tarentum to the Romans, not that he had any political power, but because he was an architect and owing to some repairs they were making in the wall had been entrusted with the keys of the gate leading to the interior. He then took refuge with the Romans, but later when he was detected in sending letters and messages from the Roman camp to Tarentum and to Hannibal, he foresaw what would be the result and this time sought safety with Philip, at whose court he acquired such credit and power that he was almost the chief instrument of the ruin of that mighty kingdom.""

Let us also realize that during this time we had Mithraists, Manicheans, and many other cults and Christian denominations such as Donatists and Novationists. 

But the Peripatetic of Aristotle's lyceum is hardly heard of or perhaps its students associated with other schools or sects. 

But the two schools which we are concerned with, the Epicurean and Stoic, just seem to wither away. Especially the Epicurean.

1640625895,Question about Caesar,"So I have read somewhere that historians seem to think that Caesar had a strange head shape (almost lopsided) due to the shape of his head on a certain bust. Is this true? And if it is, I don't think I agree with historians. 

I cut hair fairly regularly and have cut and seen a lot of different balding people and it got me thinking... So, everyone has more hair on one side of their head due to a preference of sleeping either on their left side or right side. This is because the fabric of your pillow rubs against your head and will pull hairs out. So if you sleep on your left side most of the time, the hair on the left side of your head will be thinner than on the right. This is what I think the abnormal head shape is from.

Could that be true? It's well documented that Caesar was balding, and balding on the top of the head would make the differences in hair density between the two sides of the head appear more exaggerated. So maybe his head wasn't weirdly shaped...maybe he just really liked sleeping on his right side of his body.",ancientrome

1640531599,"Constantine and the elimination of the Kalends, Nones, and Ides","This one is a bit tough but lets get into it. 

I am writing this post six days before the Kalends of January, which we know is the month of Janus. 

Now this way of ascribing dates was used for practically all of Rome's history. 

The Kalends being the first day of the month, the Nones being the ninth, and the ides being the division in the middle, usually the fifteenth. 

If Caesar had died three days later, folks wouldn't say ""Caesar died on the eighteenth of March"", they would say ""Caesar died three days after the ides of March"" 

It's a very interesting way of looking at dates because the seven day week didn't exist. Your birthday was always in relation to either the Kalends, the Nones, or the Ides. 

This changes in the fourth century, but we hardly hear about how this was done. The admiration for seven days come from the book of Genesis where it is said God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh. 

What was once _Dies Solis_ (Day of the Sun) became _Dies Dominica_ (Day of the Lord) and we see this in many languages such as Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and French. While German, English, and many others retained Dies Solis and hence why we have Sunday. This was done much later by Theodosius in 383. It is the official seal of Christendom in the Roman empire 

But this renaming isn't so much what we're concerned about in this post so much as the implementation of the seven day week and the elimination of the Kalends, Nones and Ides system. 

This must have been very confusing for folks. Is there any ancient material that talks about this transition? I've been reading many things from the Constantine and Valentinian eras but havent found something discussing this.",ancientrome

1640439382,How close was Claudius Gothicus to the Roman Senatorial elite?,"We can see how things change when Gallienus dies and the throne is passed to Claudius surnamed Gothicus. 

Valerian and his son, Gallienus grew up in Severan Italy. They were metropolitan Latin men who although not the most elite of that class, was in any case more similar to them than Claudius and Aurelian. 

We remember how the Roman world came to a panic in 69 AD and Vespasian assumed power. A man who would be unthinkable while Nero was alive. The prime men were those related to the Julio-Claudian stock. 

But we see this very interesting shift with Claudius taking the imperial power and fighting the Goths. Almost like old Marius taking the consulship by the horns and fighting the Cimbri. 

What were the Roman senators and Praetorian guard doing at this time? What made them just go with the flow with these Illyrian emperors? Surely the memory of Thrax was not that distant. 

I would think that after Gallienus died, they would at least try to put one of their own men up. But this fierce soldier was able to win their admiration I guess and seeing how fractured the empire was, I guess maybe they noticed beggars can't be choosers? 

I personally like to divide the Crisis of the third century into four periods:
Instability (235-253)
Collapse (253-268)
Recovery (268-276)
Stability (276-284) 

We see the imperial position really being pushed to the edge with Gallienus and Valerian.

Where the shepherds  on that glorious night had greeted the infant Saviour, singing in harmony with the host of angels in heavenly joy, a  mixed crowd of harlots and eunuchs lamented for Venus‚Äô  lover! How sad this is! What human devotion will be able to atone for such impiety? Where the sacred Child, the baby Saviour, had uttered His cries, that ill-famed rite  shrieked with the wanton grief of those counterfeiting the  laments of Venus. Where the Virgin had borne her child, adulterers were worshipped.  

This wickedness of an earlier age continued to the  time of Constantine, shortly before our day. He deserved  to be prince of the princes of Christ as much through the  faith of his mother Helena as through his own. The outcome proved that she was inspired by God‚Äôs plan when she  set eyes on Jerusalem. As co-regent with the title Augusta,  she asked her son to give her a free hand in clearing all the  sites there on which our Lord‚Äôs feet had trod, and which  were stamped with remembrances of God‚Äôs works for us. She sought to cleanse them of all the infection of profane  wickednesses by pulling down temples and statues, and to  restore them to their rightful allegiance so that the Church  might at last be famed in the land of its beginnings.

1639854148,"Discourse between the philosophical, pagan, and christian traditions in the Roman world","**Augustine** says in his *Civitate Dei* the following 

""  They say that they are called *monsters,* because they demonstrate or signify something; *portents,* because they portend something; and so forth. But let their diviners see how they are either deceived, or even when they do predict true things, it is because they are inspired by spirits, who are intent upon entangling the minds of men (worthy, indeed, of such a fate) in the meshes of a hurtful curiosity, or how they light now and then upon some truth, because they make so many predictions."" (Book 21.8)

**Cicero** talks very much about the fallacies of divinations and even the Bacchnalian rites in his *Divintione*, and also says "" But for my part, believing as I¬†do that the gods do care for man, and that they advise and often forewarn him, I¬†approve of divination which is not trivial and is free from falsehood and trickery."" (On Divinaton)

Augustine condemns these traditions as 'demons', on the other hand Cicero views them with his nonchalant indifference. We likewise see **Seneca** taking this view when he condemns the lifestyle of the multitude and that the wise man practices the reading of philosophy and consults the great men of the past in practically all of his letters to Lucilius and his larger works.

**Celsus** likewise urges this path in life but **Origen** refutes him by saying 

"" For who is there that, on betaking himself to the study of philosophy, and throwing himself into the ranks of some sect, either by chance, or because he is provided with a teacher of that school, adopts such a course for any other reason, except that he believes his particular sect to be superior to any other? For, not waiting to hear the arguments of all the other philosophers, and of all the different sects, and the reasons for condemning one system and for supporting another, he in this way elects to become a Stoic, e.g., or a Platonist, or a Peripatetic, or an Epicurean, or a follower of some other school"" (Contra Celsum)

But I think an excellent description is found in Origen where he says 

"" But since the course alluded to is impossible, partly on account of the necessities of life, partly on account of the weakness of men, as only a very few individuals devote themselves earnestly to study, what better method could be devised with a view of assisting the multitude, than that which was delivered by Jesus to the heathen? And let us inquire, with respect to the great multitude of believers, who have washed away the mire of wickedness in which they formerly wallowed, whether it were better for them to believe without a reason, and to have become reformed and improved in their habits "" (Contra Celsum)

**Zosimus** gives us an accout of what **Theodosius** said to the pagans in the fourth of book of *Historia Nova* regarding the expences of the ceremonies.

"" Theodosius, therefore, told them, that the treasury was too much exhausted by the expence of sacred rites and sacrifices, and that he should, therefore, abolish them, since he neither thought them commendable, nor could the exigencies of the army spare so much money. The Senate in reply observed, that the sacrifices were not duly performed, unless the charges were defrayed from the public funds. Yet thus the laws for the performance of sacred rites and sacrifices were repealed and abolished, besides other institutions and ceremonies, which had been received from their ancestors ""

This is quite an impressive blow to the ancient traditions and although the Stoics, Peripatetics, Epicureans, and many others likewise criticized the flashy festivals and ceremonies, they never really were able to curtail their expenditure that much and force their philosophies on the people. In other words, they did not proselytize. 

Various civilizations and city-states criticized each other for being too decadent, too sensuous, and even too supersititious as we see in **Caesar** Gallic Wars where he criticizes the Gauls and Druids for their uncivilized superstitions in book 6 

Moreover, we also see **Juvenal** rolling his eyes at Roman women for following Chaldean astrologers saying: 

""But even greater faith‚Äôs placed in the Chaldeans: whatever the astrologer claims, women will believe to have issued out of Ammon‚Äôs oasis, the Oracle at Delphi having fallen silent, and the human race now blind as regards the future. Yet the first of these astrologers is the one most often exiled. They‚Äôll trust his skill, if his right hand‚Äôs rattled the chains, His left too, if he‚Äôs languished in some distant military gaol. No astrologer lacking a criminal record possesses any talent..."" (Satire 6)

It's very interesting to see how Christianity was able to leverage its way between the vast number of pagan tradtions and cults while the philosophical schools really just contained themselves in their own little ivory tower.",ancientrome

1639808743,"How can anybody be an admirer of Roman history and like HBO's ""Rome""?","I find it incredible that certain persons in this subreddit still wax poetically about HBO's ""Rome"".  If there were ever a show that mangled Roman history to an incredible level, that was it.  The show was supposed to provide an ""authentic"" experience, at the very least, but it did not even manage this. 

Most of the plot was ridiculous.  Considering that it dealt with a very well-known period of history, it managed to make it unrecognizable.  Julius Caesar is presented like an oversexed fool pursuing a mid-50's lady (Servilia) to the degree that he forgets to pursue the civil war and has to be shamed to finally go after Pompey.  He is also scheming to sell his veterans short.  Nothing of which is even remotely true.  Octavian, a known prude sleeps with his sister; why not try a little incest?  Cleopatra is a perennially doped-up idiot who does not know what is coming or going.  doped-up.  Brutus kills Caesar because his mother, Servilia, put him up for this.  Listen, this stuff could have been the foundation of a great comedy!!

Then one comes to the key characters, Pullo and Vorenus.  Here the plot just goes to typical tropes of two army buddies, as if the Roman army was nothing more than the US military fighting with just swords.  The total experience of soldiers and centurions in the Roman army was absolutely different from any models that one is familiar with.  Nothing can be as inauthentic of Rome as these characters.  For much of the rest of the show, one has the ""Gangs of New York"" translated into a toga-clad script.

Although the show recreated the Roman forum adequately (there were a few discrepancies), much of the rest was not even close to what one would have experienced living in that period.  The most laughable part was the depiction of Alexandria.  Subreddit members here can easily find digital recreations of Alexandria of that period.  What was in the show resembled more Pi Rameses, the capital of Egypt 1200 years earlier.  So much for authenticity.  Everything in Egypt was laughable. 

Some redditors here say that the show creators did not want to film a ""documentary"".  This is laughable.  One can create a very good show while staying close to recorded history.  A great example of this is BBC's  ""I Claudius"".  All the facts are accurate; the motivations are, of course, the creations of the author, Robert Graves.  I am more than sure that Claudius did not designate Nero as his heir because he wanted Britannicus to restore the Republic.  He definitely did, anyway, and he never recorded his motivations regarding this for posterity.  Just parenthetically, after the Messalina coup that he barely survived, he needed a true Julian in the succession to restore confidence in the credentials of the imperial family....but this is another matter.

In conclusion, those who watch Rome get a Julius Caesar who is a parody of the real man, have a totally warped idea of what happened and why, and have not watched anything nearly authentic.  it was really only a toga show of extremely low quality.  HBO was correct in cancelling it.",ancientrome

1639642530,Story of Spartacus ( continued) Part 3,"In the Spartacus army, there was a split from it, 30 thousand people separated under the command of Crixus. This detachment of rebels (historians to this day argue about their composition ‚Äì were they Germans or Italians) in the battle of Mount Gargano in Northern Apulia was destroyed by the Romans under the command of the consul Lucius Gellius. If the legionnaires took the rebels prisoner, it was only in order to execute them.

Such a loss greatly weakened the army of Spartacus. However, the leader of the rebellious Roman slaves turned out to be a talented commander. Taking advantage of the disunity of the actions of the advancing armies of the consuls G. Lentula and L. Gellius, he defeated them one by one. A well-organized and trained army of rebel slaves demonstrated their superiority over the Roman legions in every battle.

After two such heavy defeats, the Roman Senate had to draw up troops from distant provinces to Italy hastily. After these two great victories, Spartacus‚Äô army marched along Italy‚Äôs Adriatic coast. But even as the Carthaginian commander Hannibal, the leader of the rebellious slaves, did not go to Rome, which was in awe of the real threat of the appearance of a huge army of rebellious slaves and the Italian poor before its walls.

In northern Italy, in the province of Cisalpine Gaul, at the Battle of Mutin (south of the Padus Po) in 72, Spartacus utterly defeated the troops of the proconsul Cassius. From Mutina, the Romans fled to the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is known that Spartacus did not pursue Cassius.

Now the rebellious slaves, who dreamed of finding freedom, were within easy reach of the Alps. Nobody stopped them from crossing the Alps and ending up in Gaul. However, for unknown reasons, the army of the rebels turned back from Mutina and, once again bypassing Rome, went to the South of the Apennine Peninsula, keeping close to the coast of the Adriactic sea

The Roman Senate sent a new army against the rebellious slaves, this time 40,000, under the command of the experienced commander Marcus Licinius Crassus, who came from the equestrian class and was distinguished by cruelty in establishing proper order in the army. He receives under his command six Roman legions and auxiliary troops. Crassus‚Äôs legions consisted of experienced, war-hardened soldiers.

In the fall of 72, an army of rebellious slaves concentrated on the Bruttian Peninsula of Italy (present-day province of Calabria). They intended to cross the Strait of Messina to the island of Sicily on the ships of Asia Minor Cilician pirates. Most likely, Spartacus decided to raise slaves to revolt in this, one of the richest provinces of Ancient Rome, which was considered one of his granaries. In addition, the history of this Italian region knew many performances of slaves with weapons in their hands, and Spartacus most likely heard about this.

However, the Cilician pirates, fearing to become blood enemies of the powerful Rome, deceived Spartacus, and their naval fleets did not come to the shores of Bruttia, to the port of Regia. There were no ships in the same port city since the rich Roman townspeople, when the rebels approached, left Rhegium on them. Attempts to cross the Strait of Messina on homemade rafts were unsuccessful.

Meanwhile, the army of Marcus Licinius Crassus went into the rear of the rebellious slaves. The legionaries erected a line of typical Roman fortifications at the narrowest point of the Bruttian Peninsula, which cut off Spartacus‚Äôs army from the rest of Italy. A moat was dug from sea to sea (about 55 kilometers long, 4.5 meters wide and deep) and poured into a high bank.",ancientrome

1639603654,Story of Spartacus (continued)Part 2,"By the beginning of 73 BC. Spartacus‚Äô detachment quickly grew to 10 thousand people. The ranks of the rebellious gladiators were daily replenished by fugitive slaves, gladiators, the ruined peasants of the Campania province, and defectors from the Roman legions. Spartacus sent out small detachments to the surrounding estates, freeing slaves everywhere and taking away weapons and food from the Romans. Soon the whole Campania, with the exception of the cities protected by strong fortress walls, was in the hands of the rebellious slaves.

Soon Spartacus wins a series of convincing victories over the Roman troops, who were trying to suppress the slave uprising in the bud and destroy its participants. The summit of Vesuvius and the approaches to the extinct volcano became the scene of bloody battles. The Roman historian Sallust wrote about Spartacus of those days that he and his fellow gladiators were ready ‚Äúto die from iron rather than from hunger.‚Äù

In the fall of 72, the army of the praetor Publius Varinius was completely defeated, and he himself was almost captured, which plunged the authorities of Rome into considerable confusion. And before that, the Spartacists utterly defeated the Roman legion under the command of the¬†praetor Clodius, who presumptuously set up his fortified camp right on the only path that led to the summit of Vesuvius.

Then the gladiators weaved a long staircase from the vine and descended along it from the mountain cliff at night. The Roman legion, suddenly attacked from the rear, was defeated.

Spartacus showed excellent organizational skills, turning the army of rebellious slaves into a well-organized army, modeled on the Roman legions. In addition to the infantry, the Spartacus army had cavalry, scouts, messengers, a small baggage train, which did not burden the troops during their marching life.

Weapons and armor were either captured from the Roman troops or made in the camp of the rebels. The training of troops was established, and also according to Roman models. The teachers of slaves and the Italian poor were former gladiators and fugitive legionnaires, who perfectly wielded various weapons and military formation of the Roman legions.

The army of rebellious slaves was distinguished by high morale and discipline. Initially, commanders of all ranks were chosen from among the most experienced and reliable gladiators and then appointed by Spartacus himself. Management of the Spartacus army was built on a democratic basis and consisted of a council of military leaders and a meeting of soldiers. A firm routine was established for camp and marching life.

Almost nothing is known about the other leaders of the powerful slave uprising in ancient Rome. History has preserved only the names of Kirks(Crixus) and Enomai(Oenamus), two, apparently, Germans, who were elected by the rebellious gladiators as assistants to Spartacus, becoming the commanders of his army.

The first victories of the rebellious slaves met with a wide response. From Campania, the uprising spread to the southern regions of Italy ‚Äì Apulia, Lucania, Bruttia. By the beginning of 72, Spartacus‚Äô army had grown to 60 thousand people, and during the campaign to the South, it reached, according to various sources, the number of 90-120 thousand people.

The Roman Senate was extremely concerned about the extent of the slave revolt. Two armies were sent against Spartacus, led by experienced and famous victories by the generals ‚Äì the consuls Gnaeus Lentulus and Lucius Gellius. They hoped to succeed by taking advantage of the disagreements that had begun among the rebels.

A significant part of the slaves wanted to escape from Italy through the Alps in order to find freedom and return to their homeland. Among them was Spartacus himself. However, the Italian poor who joined the slaves did not want this.",ancientrome

1639591352,Story of Spartacus,"Presumably, Spartacus was born in Thrace (modern Bulgaria). Antique authors report conflicting information about his life. According to some sources, he was a prisoner of war, fell into slavery, and was assigned to the gladiatorial school in Capua (City in Italy). According to another version, the Thracian served as a mercenary in the Roman army, then fled and, being captured, was given to the¬†gladiators.

Spartacus was distinguished by physical strength, dexterity, and courage, skillfully wielded weapons. For his abilities, he gained freedom and became a fencing teacher at a gladiatorial school. Spartacus enjoyed great prestige among the gladiators of the Capua school of Lentula Batiak and then among the rebellious slaves of Ancient Rome.

About the physical strength of Spartacus and his mental talents, Plutarch, a Greek philosopher, said that ‚Äúhe was more like an educated Hellene than a barbarian.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe himself is great in his own strengths of body and soul‚Äù ‚Äì this is how another ancient Roman writer Sallust speaks of the leader of the rebellious slaves.

The greatest slave revolt in the ancient world had the most fertile ground. Wars flooded Italy with slaves of various ethnic groups Gauls, Germans, Thracians, Hellenized inhabitants of Asia and Syria‚Ä¶ The bulk of the slaves were employed in agriculture and were in extremely difficult conditions.

Due to their brutal exploitation, the life of the Roman slaves was extremely short-lived. However, this did not particularly disturb the¬†slave owners, since the victorious campaigns of the Roman army ensured an uninterrupted supply of cheap slaves to the slave markets.

Of the city slaves, gladiators were in a special position. Not a single celebration could do without gladiatorial performances in ancient Rome of that era. Well-trained and trained gladiators were released into the arena to kill each other for the joy of thousands of Roman citizens.

There were special schools where physically strong slaves were taught the art of gladiators. One of the most famous schools of gladiators was located in the province of Campania, in the city of Capua.

The uprising of slaves in ancient Rome began with the fact that a group of gladiator slaves (about 70 people) fled from the Capua school after discovering a conspiracy and taking refuge at the summit of Mount Vesuvius.

In total, there were more participants in the conspiracy under the leadership of Spartacus ‚Äì 200 people, but the guards of the gladiatorial school and the city of Capua defeated the conspirators at the very beginning of their performance. The fugitives have entrenched themselves on the inaccessible mountain peak, turning it into a military camp. Only one narrow path led to it from the valley.",ancientrome

It was so wonderful and panoramic. 

Reading about these heroic Romans opening themselves up to the world and charting in new territories. Culminating finally in young Augustus and the annexation of Ptolemaic Egypt. 

Then we move into such a new world that a certain luster is lost. I even felt sad when I reading on the death of old Lepidus. A man who died in such a different Rome than the one he came into. 

It hurts to read Tacitus and feel ourselves in this new chamber with Tiberius and apathetic senators. Maecenas and Agrippa are dead, the rostra lost its splendor, and while there is this threat from the Parthians and Germanic tribes, we find ourselves really in a whole new Rome. So different from that of Cato and Scipio. Even from the one of Marius and Sulla.
